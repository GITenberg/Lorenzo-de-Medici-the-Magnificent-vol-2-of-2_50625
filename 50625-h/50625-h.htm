<p class="pch">LORENZO AS A POET.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> April 1465, as already stated, Federigo of Aragon, Prince
of Naples, and Lorenzo de’ Medici, then seventeen years old,
met at Pisa. A letter addressed by the young Florentine to
his royal friend, probably in the following year, begins
thus:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ‘When thou, illustrious Federigo, didst visit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
most ancient city of Pisa, thou didst turn our conversation
to the subject of those who have written poetry in the
Tuscan language, and didst manifest a laudable desire to see
all their works collected by my care. Endeavouring to fulfil
thy wishes, I had a diligent search made for all the old
manuscripts, and chose from them the least imperfect, which
I now present to your Highness, arranged in order in a book
which I earnestly desire thee approvingly to accept, as a
token of especial goodwill. Let no one despise this Tuscan
tongue as poor and rude, for he who can rightly estimate its
value will find it rich and well cultivated. There is, indeed,
nothing vigorous or graceful, impressive or ingenious, witty,
harmonious, or majestic, of which examples may not be
found in our two greatest poets, Dante and Petrarca; and
after them, by those whom thou, Prince, hast recalled to
life.</p>

<p>‘Petrarca shows in one of his letters that the ancient
Romans were acquainted with rhyme which, after a long interval,
revived in Sicily, spread through France, and was
restored to Italy, its original home. The first who gave our
modern poetry its peculiar form of verse were Guittone of
Arezzo and his Bolognese contemporary Guido Guinicello.
They were both well versed in philosophy, and wrote profoundly;
but the first is somewhat harsh and rude, deficient
in ornament and eloquence. The latter, who is far more
clear and elegant, was called by Dante “his father,” and
the father of all who write sweet and graceful love songs.
He was unquestionably the first to impress on our beautiful
language that attractive colouring which the bard of Arezzo
had but faintly indicated. After these shone Guido Cavalcanti,
one of the keenest dialecticians and most admirable
philosophers of his time. He was handsome in person, and
his writings are to me in the highest degree attractive; his
imagination is rich and wonderfully grand; his reasoning is
weighty; his tone extremely dignified. These qualities are
heightened by the rich charm of a style that sets them off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
like a resplendent robe. He needed but a wider field to have
attained the highest honours.</p>

<p>‘Bonagiunta of Lucca and the notary of Lentino must
not be overlooked; but though earnest and weighty writers,
they were so destitute of refined taste, that they must be
content to find a place in this collection of honoured names.
Another contemporary of Guittone was Pier delle Vigne, of
whom Dante said that “he had both the keys of Frederick’s
heart.” Only a few short pieces by him remain, and they are
not wanting in depth or earnestness.</p>

<p>‘And now come the two glorious suns that have illuminated
our language&mdash;Dante, and he who stands hardly
below him, Francesco Petrarca. In praise of them, silence,
to use the words of Sallust concerning Carthage, is better
than halting speech. Greatly in need of their polish stood
Onesto, and the Sicilians who in order of time preceded
them, and who were not without spirit or purpose. Cino of
Pistoja, tender and full of feeling, deserves his reputation.
He was the first, in my opinion, who thoroughly surmounted
the antique roughness which Dante, so admirable in other
respects, could not entirely avoid. A host of writers follow,
ranking far below those I have named. All these of the
past, and some of our own time, owe lasting thanks to thee,
O Prince, who hast bestowed on them life, and light, and
fame, acquiring for thyself a claim to greater renown than
that of the Athenian Peisistratos, who rescued from oblivion
the lays of Homer. He restored life to one; thou hast
revived a whole host. At the end of the book, as it
seemed not unpleasing to thee, I have added some sonnets
and canzoni of my own, that when thou readest them, my
goodwill and affection may be vividly recalled to thy mind.
Though in themselves unworthy of a place beside the admirable
works of the past, it may be useful to set them
side by side for a comparison which can but enhance the
perfections of the latter. Pray take then, O Prince, not
only into thine house, but into thy heart and mind, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
them and me, even as thou abidest a welcome guest in my
heart and soul.’</p>

<p>Thus wrote Lorenzo de’ Medici apparently in 1466. On
a subsequent occasion, in a gloss on his own poems such as
it was the custom then for an author himself or some of his
friends to write, he gave his opinion on the much-disputed
question of the value of the vulgar tongue as the language of
poetry. ‘If we want,’ he wrote, ‘to prove the worth of our
language, we need only apply this test: does it express with
ease all our thoughts and all our feelings? Nothing can be
more satisfactory than the answer given us by experience.
Our countrymen Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio, have in their
verses and discourses, whether grave or gay, proved clearly
that every thought and feeling finds easy and natural expression
in this tongue of ours. Whoever reads the “Commedia”
sees various questions of theology and nature discussed
with as much skill as success. He finds there the three
degrees of style specified by orators&mdash;the simple, the florid,
and the sublime, nay, more&mdash;Dante in himself presents a
union of all the qualities which Greek and Latin writers
display separately. Who again can deny the warmth, tenderness,
and gaiety of Boccaccio? In his love poems he
shows a mingled grace and fervour that neither Ovid, Tibullus,
Propertius nor Catullus have equalled. Dante’s pithy sonnets
and canzoni are scarcely surpassed by anything in prose or
verse, and the readers of Boccaccio, whose learning was as
great as the polish of his style, must admit that in him the
faculty of invention contends with the variety and eloquence
of his language. Any one who examines his “Decameron”
with its endless diversity of subject, its descriptions of every
conceivable situation produced by love and hate, hope or
fear; its exhibition of countless intrigues and artifices; its
characteristic representation of diverse natures, and its expression
of every passion, will be convinced that for all this
no language can be better adapted than our own. It is not
the language that has been unfavourable to writers, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
there has been a dearth of authors who could use it. To
any one with a little practice, it is full of power, harmony,
and grace. It appears to me richly endowed with all that
constitutes the excellence of a language, and I am persuaded
that a knowledge of what has been written in it is not only
useful but necessary&mdash;more especially the works of Dante,
which are both solid and profound. The commentaries of
learned men on the “Commedia” bear witness to this no less
than the allusions made to the work from the pulpit. We
may look forward to the appearance of other excellent works
in this language, which still preserves its freshness and is
growing in elegance and copiousness. A prospect of still
greater perfection is before it, should the dominion of Florence
be extended, a thing not merely to be hoped but to be
striven for by our gallant citizens with all their energies of
body and mind. Though such a consummation cannot
positively be predicted, since it depends on fate and the will
of God, yet it is within the limits of possibility. For the
present the following conclusion is enough. Our native
speech has all the excellencies of a language in abundance,
and we ought not to be dissatisfied with it, nor ought any
one to blame me for writing in a tongue to which I was born
and in which I was educated. Hebrew and Latin originally
were no more than vulgar tongues, yet those who hold an
honoured place in literature cultivated them to a degree of
perfection that was never attained by the mass of the people.’</p>

<p>These remarks, which are followed by others on the
sonnet and on Tuscan rhythm and metre, show that from
his youth up Lorenzo de’ Medici thought much of the nature
and history of the language of his country. His poems
opened out no new path, but served with those of many
among his contemporaries to give more freedom and grace
of movement to the language, more facility for applying it
to manifold aims and objects, and a richer variety of idiomatic
forms. His masterly handling of the language was equalled
by his command of versification. Harshness he has, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that force which will not avoid a difficulty. Nor is he wanting
in archaic forms and illegitimate turns of expression,
while he has echoes of the artificial manner which in the
poet’s youth was regarded as modern classicism. We do
not always meet with the refinement of ear, accuracy of
taste, and fulness of harmony, which give such importance
to his contemporary Poliziano, and mark him as the true
leader of the great literary movement of the fifteenth century,
a movement which, in its last decade, put an end to a state
of things in which it is hard to say whether stagnation
or perverted energy was the worst feature. Nevertheless,
Lorenzo de’ Medici takes a conspicuous and peculiar place
in this movement. Had he been only a literary man, he
would have shone as such. As in his whole character, so
also as a poet, is he the true representative of his time, a
time that strove with pious care to restore the old, while it
joyfully if doubtfully anticipated the opening of new vistas
and formed the threshold between two great epochs, the
blending of the sunset and the dawn. Lorenzo de’ Medici,
while rightly estimating the character of the literature of
Dante’s age, and perceiving that it and not the pedantry of
the humanistic poets contained life and hope for the future,
was, nevertheless, still influenced by the great fact of the
first half of his century, the revival of classical culture.
Even when he most nearly approaches the lyric poets who
preceded him, it is not in imitation, like Bembo’s imitation
of Petrarca. Even when Dante or Guido Cavalcanti, with
their subtle dissection of feelings, partaking somewhat of
the character of scholasticism, and their habit of treating
even earthly things with a certain unearthly solemnity of
tone, have been most evidently his guiding lights&mdash;still,
through all, there pierces a spirit which could only have
been aroused by the contact of modes of thought derived
from the antique with modern life and experience, and by a
direct knowledge of the creations of Hellenic genius, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the fathers of Italian poetry were sealed books, whose
very titles were unknown to most of them.</p>

<p>Lorenzo de’ Medici is no imitator of Petrarca, although
echoes of Petrarca and even, through the latter, of the poetry
of the Troubadours occur frequently in his compositions.
But, apart from other details, he has one conspicuous trait
in common with Petrarca&mdash;a quick sense of the beauties of
nature. The hermit of Vaucluse and Arquà is, of all modern
poets, the first to whom nature seems to have been especially
revealed in her inner life and in the impression which she
makes on the feelings; for in Dante it is rather the historical
character of the landscape and the plasticity of sharply defined
individual phenomena which come out most strongly.
Like Petrarca, he who dwelt in the Tuscan villas and among
the wooded Apennines found in nature an inexhaustible
fountain whence flowed forth an ever-fresh stream of forms
and images clothed in the most varied and brilliant colours.
The richness and freshness of his treatment proves how quick
were his eyes to receive and his mind to realise such impressions.
He delighted to consecrate to the mental and moral
refreshment of a residence in the country the hours and
days which he could steal from his varied and often vexatious
cares and occupations. If his poetic descriptions did not
sufficiently declare it, his whole life would furnish a proof
that there was in him not merely an active fancy, but an
actual need, as well as a true and quick apprehension of
nature. He has shown in the ‘Selve d’amore,’ and in the
idyl of ‘Ambra,’ what were his powers of describing nature,
not merely in the illustration of thoughts and feelings, but
as an independent picture complete in itself.</p>

<p>The greater part of his sonnets and canzoni consists, as
may be imagined, of love poems. But the individualising
characteristics of his poetry save them from the monotony
usually inseparable from this style; for where there is no
variety of tone, there is a variety of situation and colouring.
The lover and poet is with Lorenzo always a disciple of philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and the subject of his poems, decked in all the
brilliant colours of fancy, retreats into the background infinitely
more than with the great poets of the Trecento. In
reading Lorenzo’s poems, one gives little more than a passing
thought to Lucrezia Donati, whose name even is revealed
to us only by the poet’s friends. Beatrice and Madonna
Laura have been the objects of careful historical research&mdash;scarcely
any one has troubled himself about the fair Florentine,
sprung from a race whose name filled the history of the
city when that of Medici was still unknown. The reason is
not merely that Lucrezia’s bard was no Dante or Petrarca,
and that his poetry, however fresh and genuine, and however
important as completing a character unique in its way, yet
held but a secondary place in the mind and life of Lorenzo
de’ Medici; but the ideal creation threatens to swallow up
the personality. The story connected with the beautiful
girl lying on the bier, in which the poet sets forth how he
sought and found a worthy object for his affection, sufficiently
indicates that he rather transferred to this object what had
already assumed a living shape in his own mind than received
his impulse from it. To the greatest of Italy’s poets
the angel-bride of his early youth became the ideal in which
all his thoughts and feelings were wrapt up; the ideal
stood before the eyes of Lorenzo de’ Medici before he knew
her whose form he clothed in the magic of spiritualised
desire.</p>

<p>The disciple of the Platonic philosophy, giving a description
of his beloved one in the commentary on his sonnets,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
thus declares himself in his definition of the nature of love.
‘Whoever seeks the true definition of love, will find that it
consists in the desire for beauty. This being so, whatever
is ugly repels him who truly and worthily loves. The beauty
of the countenance and soul of our beloved one impels us to
seek beauty in other things; to rise to that virtue which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beauty on earth as in heaven, and to reach at length the
highest beauty&mdash;the Divinity, our final goal and resting-place.
The necessary conditions of a true, worthy, and
elevated love, appear to me to be two: first, that the object
shall be one, then that the love shall be constant. It is not
given to all to fulfil these conditions, seeing that but few
women possess the lofty power of attaching men so entirely
to themselves that they shall never offend against the two
conditions without which there is no true love.’ But his
philosophical view of life and human happiness is contained
in a longer poem in terza rima, (‘L’Altercazione’), in which
Marsilio Ficino is personally introduced as teacher, and decides
between the poet and his interlocutor. The former
has left the tumult of the city, the confusion of party politics,
the throng of the market, to bring his soul to a haven of rest,
a life free and secure from anxiety, in the solitude of the
country. He describes what he seeks and hopes to find in
this retreat to the shepherd whom he meets; the latter
points out to him the toils and troubles of his humble lot,
and how he drags on day after day beneath ever-renewing
cares. Then Marsilio comes to place in their true light the
worth and the worthlessness of sublunary things; to show
how happiness depends neither on the high position of the
one nor the lowly station of the other, but is to be found in
the knowledge and love of the Author of all things. As may
be seen from this sketch of its contents, the poem contains
nothing original, but it is pleasing from its life-like description
of contrasts, and interesting as a token of the earnest
self-introspection of a richly and variously endowed mind.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The three idyls which we possess of Lorenzo de’ Medici
are so many witnesses to the many-sidedness of his genius.
The first, ‘Corinto’ (the name of the shepherd who sings his
love), resembles the eclogues of the ancients, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
soon to become the models of so many writers, and especially
of Sannazaro. Following the precedent of Boccaccio, it is
in terza rima, a metre better suited to a series of narratives
and descriptions than to a subject in which the lyrical element
preponderates. ‘Nencia da Barberino’ is pure nature&mdash;in
some parts severe nature, with a rich vein of quaint
humour and a charming local colour. It is an idyl in eight-lined
stanzas, redolent of Tuscan soil, describing the Tuscan
people, their manners and modes of speech, with a succession
of apostrophes, eulogies, and comparisons, including some
that are strange enough. Such are the so-called <i>rispetti</i>,&mdash;those
songs of the people, especially country people, which
sometimes in their fantastic flights soar up to the sun and
stars, and sometimes borrow their similes from the humblest
things. Lorenzo has, in fact, here put together a whole
poem of <i>rispetti</i>, in which the serious and the comic alternate,
and through the mouth of a lover has applied to one
rustic beauty what would have sufficed for a whole bevy of
maidens. These <i>rispetti</i> are evidently learned from the
people, who to this day produce thousands of these half-lyric,
half-epigrammatic songs, particularly in the hill-country
of Pistoja, for, as an old proverb says, ‘the mountaineers
have thick shoes and fine brains.’<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They are to be heard
also in other parts of the Florentine and Sienese dominions,
as far as the Maremma, from whence they extend into the
Roman Campagna. Some of the rustic verses are peculiar
to the poet, who exercises himself freely in a style that
permits great variety, and who rivals the people among whom
he mingles in fantastic flights and quaint similes, producing
a somewhat motley but richly coloured and life-like picture.
Luigi Pulci has furnished a companion piece to ‘Nencia.’
Poliziano, without confining himself to a special subject, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
also tried his hand at these little songs, which seem to flow
spontaneously from Tuscan pens, and form a branch of literature
highly important in its relation to the character of
the people.</p>

<p>While in ‘Nencia’ the popular and burlesque element
prevails, the third of these idyls, ‘Ambra,’ belongs to the
province of mythology. Its importance lies far less in the
story itself&mdash;one of the oft-told tales after the Ovidian pattern&mdash;than
in the grand descriptions of nature to which the
fable gives rise. The scene is the villa of Poggio a Cajano,
on the decoration of which the princely owner bestowed so
much trouble and expense, the results of his work being
repeatedly destroyed by the overflow of the Ombrone in its
descent from the Pistojan mountains to the level ground
around the low hill on which Cajano stood. A small islet in
the river bore the name of Ambra, which was transferred to
the villa itself. The dykes raised for its defence did not
fulfil Poliziano’s hope that the stream would spare the
flower-garden. In the poem, Ambra is the nymph beloved by
the shepherd Lauro. Her charms, seen when bathing,
attract the river god, and she only escapes from his wild
pursuit by the help of Diana, who, at her entreaty, changes
her into a rock, on which the villa is then built. As in
‘Nencia’ the ottava rima adapts itself to a burlesque and
popular subject, so here it developes a surprising power in
descriptions of the natural occurrences that caused the
destruction of the pleasant rustic dwelling, and of the events
which are made to precede them.</p>

<p>As ‘Ambra’ inclines to the descriptive, so does another
little poem in eight-line stanzas called ‘The Hawking Party’
(‘La Caccia con Falcone’), a lively picture of a universally
favourite pastime to which our poet was almost passionately
addicted. The fresh morning on which the party sets out,
the adventures and intermezzos on the way, the rivalry and
excitement of the huntsmen, the manœuvres of the chase,
with the birds and dogs, carefully trained, yet not always to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be relied on, the return in midday heat, and the cheerful
meal, which reconciles the tired disputants and brings the
day to a close,&mdash;all this is described with the most vivid
reality, and with an amount of detail that could only come
from an initiated sportsman. We are in the midst of the
cheerful company that crowded around the gay and stately
young man. For the poem dates some time before the year
1478, as is proved by the circumstance that Lorenzo’s
brother-in-law, Guglielmo de’ Pazzi, is one of the chief
persons present, together with Luigi Pulci, Foglia Amieri,
Dionigi Pucci, and several others less easy to distinguish by
name. A whole stanza is taken up with the names of the
falcons, the number of which shows that this was indeed a
princely hunt, such as often took place at Pisa or Poggio a
Cajano.</p>

<p>The poem in terza rima which bears the name of ‘I
Beoni’ (‘The Drinkers’), or ‘Simposio,’ resembles the ‘Nencia’
and the ‘Hawking Party’ in so far as it describes Florentine
and Tuscan manners. In rhythm, tone, and manner, it is
very different from the others; for although in ‘Nencia’
peasant life sometimes receives a burlesque covering, the
poem never becomes satire, nor sinks to that degree of low
comedy which degenerates into vulgarity. This, however, is
the case in the ‘Beoni,’ a series of chapters in which the poet
describes the manners and adventures of a company of jolly
fellows, whom he meets near Porta Faenza as he is returning
from Careggi, at the moment when they are setting out for
Ponte a Rifredi, a little place about a mile away from the
town, and which takes its name from a bridge over the little
stream Terzolle. The business of the company is to taste a
cask of wine which they have heard highly praised. The
poem is not wanting in humour, and offers a lively picture of
convivial rather than social manners, such as long existed in
Tuscany, and of which we possess many literary monuments.
Although unfinished, it is long, and monotonous in spite of
the variety of its situations; its dry comedy often degenerates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
into downright coarseness, such as might lead to very unfavourable
conclusions with regard to the morals even of the
higher classes and the clergy, who in part are represented
here. ‘I Beoni’ makes an unpleasant impression from
another point of view. Not only is the metre that of the
most sublime poems in the Italian language; the outward
arrangement of the poem, as well as a number of particular
turns, are burlesque imitations of the great poets. This is a
proof of keen observation, of wonderful and many-sided
power; but it has a darker side. If we are to recognise in
this production the beginning of Italian satire, we can all the
more justly measure the distance between these ‘chapters’
and those brilliant mirrors of the time which immediately
followed that of Lorenzo de’ Medici&mdash;the satires of Lodovico
Ariosto.</p>

<p>Like the ‘Beoni,’ the dance-songs (‘Canzoni a ballo’)
and the songs of the carnival (‘Canti carnascialeschi’),
especially the latter, often pass the limits which separate
social gaiety from burlesque and satire. Yet the nature and
object of these songs demand the predominance of the lyrical
element. The dance songs are explained by the old traditional
customs of the Tuscan people, and Lorenzo did but
follow examples furnished by the age of Dante; examples
differing in character of all degrees, from the grave and
sententious to the popular and comic. The musical accompaniment,
in which popular old tunes alternate with later
compositions, naturally influences the form of these songs;
but the poet handles the form with the greatest ease, and
knows how to give to metre and rhyme a variety that corresponds
with the changes of mood, and prevents the
monotony which the matter and subject might produce. For
the subject is love and its enjoyments, in which the sensual
and humorous preponderate. Here prevails the sway of that
epicureanism which sees in the material satisfaction of our
desire for enjoyment the solution of the problem of life, which
regards as lost the time spent on all else, snaps its fingers at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
severe moral judgment, and ends in outspoken nihilism, mocking
even at love and happiness. The sum of worldly wisdom
here taught is&mdash;enjoy yourself as much as you can, and lose
no time about it; it is not the action that matters, but only
that it should not reach the ears of those who would be sure
to give it a bad name; ill-will and the conflict of interests
bring blame, not things in themselves. Even more clearly
than in the dance-songs is this cynicism seen in the ‘Lays
of the Carnival,’ which, like the former, are intended for
choruses, mostly with alternate parts.</p>

<p>The following pages, which treat of the manners of the
time, will describe the bacchanals, which were not new in
Florence, but which Lorenzo de’ Medici increased, and not
merely for the humour of the thing, to a degree that
has cast on his memory a reflection which an exact comparison
of the poet’s circumstances with the past would
hardly justify. The abundant imagination and many-sided
wit of these gay compositions may be admired, but, even
were the licence less, it would be impossible to take real
pleasure in them when once the purpose underlying them is
perceived. Such songs were traditional in Florence and
other places, as were also the people’s carnival societies, of
which Lorenzo made use for his popular festivals, and for
which he wrote even in the days of his highest authority&mdash;perhaps
even more especially then. To these songs the
accomplished choir-master of San Giovanni, the German
Heinrich Isaak, commonly called Arrigo Tedesco, composed
melodies for three voices. Even before the event which
exercised so great and injurious an influence on life and
morals&mdash;the plague of 1348&mdash;songs were openly sung, the
levity and revolting coarseness of which contrasted strangely
with the pious canticles which resounded in the evening
before the image of the Madonna and other shrines. The
‘Decameron’ refers to them, and the Chronicles of Modena
give us the beginning of a drinking-song which bears witness
to the confusion of tongues that had arisen, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
among the mercenary bands: ‘Trinche gote Malvasie&mdash;mi
non biver oter vin.’ The poems destined for singing
increase in number from the fourteenth century onwards.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Lorenzo only perfected in form, rendered more significant,
and finally turned to account for other purposes, what he
found ready in the life of the people. A greater contrast to
these frivolous productions than even his wanderings on the
heights of speculation, his effusions of philosophic poetry
and tender aspiring sentiment, is offered by the poems on
religious subjects, of which Lorenzo found examples in his
own family. The mystery-play, ‘Rappresentazione dei SS.
Giovanni e Paolo,’ composed, according to the prologue
spoken by the angel of the Annunciation, for the brotherhood
of San Giovanni, is said to have been acted at the
festivities which celebrated the marriage of Maddalena de’
Medici. It is certain that Lorenzo’s son, Giuliano, then just
ten, and perhaps also Piero, took part with other youths and
boys of noble houses in the representation held by the said
company in 1489. The legend of Constantia, daughter of
Constantine the Great, who was said to have been cured of
leprosy at the tomb of St. Agnes on the Nomentan Way, and
that of the martyrs John and Paul, who suffered death in
Rome on the Cœlian, are here blended with the story of the
division of the empire among Constantine’s sons, of the reign
of Julian the Apostate, and his death in the Parthian war,
and formed into a whole in which strange confusion and
leaps from one subject to another do not prevent much
poetical beauty and moral and political teaching. Like
other earlier and contemporary pieces of this kind, it is more
lyric than dramatic; in particular it has no dramatic unity.
But if the dramatic element is weak, the historical character
of one of the two chief persons, the Emperor Julian, shows
an accuracy of conception which, with regard to this prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
must have been rare at that period. In this respect
Lorenzo’s drama commands an interest far superior to that
which we take in most productions of this class. Since the
statue of Victory was taken away from the Curia&mdash;so speaks
the Emperor&mdash;success no longer crowns the Roman arms,
which once subdued the world. Only by returning to our
old gods can we recall victory to our standards. But the
object is not to be attained by this alone, or by taking from
the Christians wealth and goods which should be forbidden
them by the teachings of their own faith. The head of the
empire must again command the old reverence, and this
cannot be if the ruler hands over the cares of government to
others, while he heaps up treasure and thinks only of amusement.
If he is rich, his riches are but lent him to share with
his people, and relieve necessity wherever he finds it. Power
and property belong not to him, but to the community; he
is the steward who has the satisfaction and the glory of distributing
to others what fate has placed in his hands.</p>

<p>Julian is a man of energy, conscious of the extent and
difficulty of his task; Constantine in his old age is the representative
of the melancholy which overcomes him, who feels
that the burden of government has become too heavy for his
shoulders. Who knows whether the poet is not drawing
from the experience of his own heart when he puts into the
mouth of his hero the description of the labours and dangers
of sovereignty, which wear out body and soul, while others
see in it the height of happiness, never reflecting that <i>they</i>
can sleep while one is watching who holds the scales in his
hand, to whom all eyes are turned; who lives not for himself,
but for others, who must be the servant of servants:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">How often does the man that envies me<br />
Not know that happier far than I is he.</p>

<p class="p1">Strange contrasts of height and depth there were in this
man&mdash;contradictions in his life as well as in his poetry. Like
his mother, he tried his hand on spiritual songs, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hymns of praise display an individuality and fulness of conception
wanting to other compositions of this kind which
perhaps surpass his in freshness and simplicity. Besides
songs in which the teachings of Platonism give a peculiar
colouring to the faith of the Church, we find others in which
the tone of the older hymns to Mary has been successfully
adopted. If these lauds have not the same ardently soaring
strain as those of Benivieni; still we can well imagine that
they were sung alternately with the latter when the opposition
to the worldly spirit encouraged by their author had
gained the victory. This, too, is one of the contrasts which
abound in the history of Lorenzo de’ Medici. The lauds
give us a deep insight into his mind. They are, in some
degree, the agonised cry of a soul which, instead of finding
satisfaction in the glory and splendour, the wealth and
enjoyments of the world, is repelled by its emptiness, and
feels driven further and further away from the highest good,
of which the love once kindled within it had grown cold
amid the cares and pleasures of this life:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Thou seekest life where nought hath living breath;<br />
Thou seekest joy where nought avails save death.</p>

<p class="pch">MARSILIO FICINO AND CRISTOFORO LANDINO.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> order to gain a complete view both of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s
own life and of his influence on the scientific progress of his
time, it is necessary to contemplate the circle in which he
was placed in his youth, and which, though greatly modified
in the course of years, preserved the same character in
essentials to the end. The persons of whom it was composed
carry us back to the time of Cosimo. The first we
meet are Marsilio Ficino and Cristoforo Landino. Both
owed their rise to the house of Medici; both contributed to
its glory.</p>

<p>The last twenty-five years at least of Ficino’s life were
occupied with the endeavour to reconcile Platonism and
Christianity, to make the one expand within the other. At
the end of 1473, when forty years old, he entered holy orders,
after seriously weighing the duties and obligations of that
sacred office, and after coming to the conclusion that there is
nothing on earth nobler than a good priest, nothing more
vile than an unworthy one. At the same time he held
counsel with his own mind as to the direction of his philosophical
studies. The example of St. Augustine, who, after
he became a Christian, inclined to the Platonics of the Christian
era, decided him the more easily, because it confirmed
the direction of his whole previous life. When he became
aware how Platonism recognises Christian dogma on account
of the analogies which the latter presents to its own
doctrines, he thanked God, and felt himself confirmed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Christian faith. He did not, however, long remain free from
a suspicion of the divergence which Platonism had caused
in the mediæval development of Christian teaching from the
Aristotelian system, which was the standing-ground of
scholasticism, in its efforts to reconcile the faith of the
Church with the researches of reason. He had started from
the view that religion and philosophy are sisters. As true
philosophy, he says, is the loving study of truth and wisdom&mdash;as
God alone is truth and wisdom&mdash;so true philosophy is
nothing but genuine religion, and genuine religion nothing
but true philosophy. Religion is innate in every man;
every religion is good, in so far as it turns to God, but
Christianity is the only true one, inspired by the divine
power which dwelt in its Founder. For himself, he declares
he needs nothing but the teaching of Christ. He would
rather believe divine things than know human ones; for
divine faith is more secure than human knowledge, and what
proceeds from it is confirmed by true science. But there are
spirits for whom the authority of the divine law is not
enough, and who require the arguments of reason. Divine
Providence has ordained that the teachings of Platonism
should agree in many things with those of Christianity, in
order to bring such spirits to Christ; for, as Augustine said,
with the exception of a few things the Platonists were
Christians. As Plato always connects religion with philosophy,
and does not merely disclose to us the principles and
order of natural things, like Aristotle, but teaches us our
duty towards Him who orders all things by number, measure,
and weight; so he himself has no other object than to make
this intimate connection clear, so far as his weak powers
permit.</p>

<p>Any one who puts together his numerous remarks on
Christianity, dogma, and morality, although he may deem
some of his views peculiar, cannot reproach him with constructing
a Christianity of his own. Though he found such
an agreement between Moses and Plato that he saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
latter only a Moses writing in the Attic tongue, and though
he compared the life of Socrates with the life of Jesus, yet
he acknowledged in the Socratic doctrines only a confirmation
of the Christian, and guarded himself against seeing in
the Greek philosopher a shadow of the Saviour, and from
interpreting the Christian mysteries by Platonic writings.
Strange was the position of the thinkers of that time, placed
as they were between Christianity and the strongly-reviving
influences of heathen antiquity, and we should do them great
injustice did we not consider the spirit which governed the
whole of that period. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola believed
he had found in the Cabala the foundation of the faith and
the explanation of the Christian mysteries; both he and
Marsilio held confidential evening discussions with learned
Jewish doctors on the divine inspiration of the Prophecies,
and plunged deep into both ancient and mediæval Hebrew
lore. By a gradual enlightenment of his mind, filled with
the fantastic images of the later Platonism and the half
rationalistic mysticism founded on it, Pico came back to the
pure Christian faith, which finds in Holy Scripture a living
heavenly force whose wonderful power raises man to the
height of divine love. Marsilio Ficino’s mysticism, increased
by his strong tendency to astrology, assumed in
more than one of his writings a colouring which made his
friends uneasy. In 1489 he was even accused of magic
before Pope Innocent VIII., but was cleared of the charge
partly by his own apology, partly by his friends, Francesco
Soderini, Ermolao Barbaro, and the archbishop Rinaldo
Orsini, who was then at Rome.</p>

<p>Marsilio Ficino always keeps in view the connection between
Christianity and philosophy, both in his speculations
and in the practical application of his principles and their
corollaries. If we are astonished at the fantastic flights
which seem to lead him far away from the course he had
traced out for himself, we yet gain a clear and comprehensive
development of the aim of his whole teaching, the attainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the highest happiness by the individual as well
as by the community, the end for which God created us. In
the harmony between the spirit of government and the divine
law, whence the written law is derived, he recognises the
essential element of general well-being. As regards forms of
government, he decides that many are good, if rightly administered&mdash;aristocracy,
if its limits are not too narrow;
democracy, if it produces respect for law. Mob rule is a
polypus, all limbs and no head; tyranny has no legal ground
and no legitimate limits. Monarchy would be preferable, if
it could be maintained according to Plato’s ideal, by power
and wisdom united. But the true end of all forms of government
and civil constitutions, both in theory and practice, can
be reached neither by the few nor by the many, but only by
the co-operation of the united forces of the human race,
by the maintaining and enforcing of uniform laws by a
ruler who is raised above all enmity, ambition, and envy,
because he is acknowledged and loved by all. The Christian
Platonist, who lived to see the beginning of the new era, the
dawn of which had been heralded by the school to which he
attached himself, arrived at the summit of his philosophical
and political speculations exactly at the same standpoint
which the greatest poet of the middle ages had reached more
than a century and a half before him, amid the conflict of
parties in the State. Wide as was the difference between
their positions and experiences of life, and between the civil
and political conditions both of their own immediate home
and of a large part of Italy, this is a remarkable circumstance,
which explains the interest felt by Marsilio Ficino in
that book, so diversely judged, in which Dante Alighieri
developes his theory of monarchy&mdash;a
work well-nigh forgotten, despised by the learned on account of its style, and
sealed to the generality, till the Platonist of the Medicean
times made it accessible to his contemporaries by a translation.</p>

<p>Numerous works were composed by Marsilio Ficino, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
occupied himself not only with philosophy but with theology,
medicine, and music, and was wont to say that they belonged
to each other like body, soul, and spirit in nature. His book
on Christian doctrine, begun after his entrance into the
priesthood, seems to have been finished in the beginning of
1475, and appeared in the following year, with a declaration
that the author submitted himself in all things to the judgment
of the Church. He presented his work to Lorenzo de’
Medici. Rather more than two years later he seems to have
finished his translation of Plato’s works from the manuscripts
given him by Cosimo and by Amerigo Benci. These he
submitted to the revision of Demetrius Chalcondylas, Antonio
Vespucci, and Giovan Battista Buoninsegni, and also sought
advice from Angelo Poliziano, Landino and Bartolommeo
Scala. Filippo Valori bore the expenses of the printing,
which seems to have been completed at the end of 1482&mdash;a
proof how men of high Florentine families assumed the
character of Mæcenas. Meanwhile, the industrious writer
had concluded his great work on the Platonic doctrine of
immortality (‘Theologia Platonica de immortalitate animarum’),
which came out at the same time with the translation
of the writings on which it was founded. The Laurentian
library possesses the parchment manuscript which was given
to Lorenzo. It contains ideas new and old blended together,
and comprising the philosophic system of its author and
the defence of the supernatural against Materialism and
Pantheism, which at that time numbered many disciples, in
opposition to the Platonic school. The scientific value of
this work, in which the doctrines of Plato and the teachings
of his most dissimilar scholars in ancient and modern times
are not easy to distinguish, must rest on its own merits, as
must the validity of Lorenzo’s remark that the Materialists,
for whom there is no life in the next world, are already dead
in this. But we cannot deny the importance of Ficino’s
great work in the history of civilisation, nor question its
beneficial influence on the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed a series of smaller writings on separate
questions of philosophy, translations connected with them,
and a life of Plato. Cosimo de’ Medici wished to see the
works of Plotinus translated by Ficino, an undertaking to
which the latter only devoted himself long after the death
of its originator, and to which he was chiefly encouraged by
Pico della Mirandola. According to his own words, he recognised
in this new task a leading of Providence. As the
Latin nations had learned to know Plato, the collector of the
traditions of religious philosophy, so they should also learn
to know Plotinus, who first drew forth from darkness the
theology of the ancients and searched into its mysteries.
This work was finished in 1486, and a detailed commentary
on it in the summer of 1491. Lorenzo had undertaken to
defray the cost of printing, and promised to do the same for
a new edition of Plato’s works, the former one being inadequate.
But the printing was only completed a month
after the death of the generous patron&mdash;‘magnifico sumptu
Laurentii patriæ servatoris.’ After this came a translation
of the mystic theology of the writer calling himself Dionysius
the Areopagite. Lorenzo Valla, who surpassed most
of his contemporaries in keenness of criticism and knowledge
of antiquity, had already raised a doubt as to its genuineness,
as had also other writers. But this work, perhaps that of a
Platonist of the fifth century, fitted in with Marsilio’s system
too well not to be accepted by him as valid testimony; another
example showing how, like the Alexandrian school, these
later disciples wandered from their original models without
knowing or intending it; with this difference, that the
Neoplatonism of old ran in sharp contradiction to Christianity,
while that of more modern times aimed at a union
with it.</p>

<p>The philosophic ‘Macrobioticon,’ an original work, was
finished in 1490, and dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici and
King Matthias Corvinus. Far more interest attaches to
Marsilio’s correspondence, which embraces the twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
between 1474 and 1494&mdash;the only product of his literary
activity that has a real value at the present time. In these
letters his opinions and motives are mirrored with life-like
originality, and they afford much information as to his life,
his occupations, his social relations, and his friends. The
twelve books (which he, following the example of many contemporaries,
arranged himself, because apocryphal writings
were in circulation) are all dedicated to men of high position
or friends of the author: Giuliano de’ Medici, Federigo of
Montefeltro, Matthias Corvinus, Bernardo Bembo, Filippo
and Niccolò Valori, and others.</p>

<p>Marsilio’s extraordinary literary activity, the more astonishing
in a man of delicate health, did not interfere with the
performance of his duties as a priest or as a secular teacher.
He preached often, not only in his own parish church at
Nevoli, but also in Florence, at the church of the Angeli and
in the cathedral. His personal relations, to which his
correspondence bears witness, were very numerous. Paol’
Antonio Soderini, Giovanni Cavalcanti, Carlo Marsuppini
the younger, Piero and Giovanni Guicciardini, Bernardo
Canigiani, Bernardo Dovizj of Bibiena, afterwards cardinal;
Lorenzo’s nephew Cosimo de’ Pazzi, Bernardo Rucellai, Pier
Filippo Pandolfini, Francesco Sassetti, Ugolini Verini, and
many others, were his pupils and remained attached to him;
while from Leon Battista Alberti and Cristoforo Landino
downwards, all the learned men whom Florence or Italy possessed
were in communication with him. At an important
moment of his life he called three of these, namely, Piero
Soderini (afterwards Gonfaloniere for life), Piero del Nero, and
Piero Guicciardini, his three brothers in the search after truth;
and on March 6, 1482, he stood sponsor to Guicciardini’s son,
afterwards the famous statesman and historian. Foreign
lands as well as Italy sent their sons to hear his lectures,
and more than one of these foreigners remained gratefully
attached to him. Among others he became acquainted with
several Germans; Johannes Reuchlin and Ludwig Wergenhans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
(Nauclerus), provost of Stuttgart, who with Gabriel
Biel, professor of scholastic philosophy at Tübingen, and the
learned theologian Peter Jacobi, of Arlon in Luxemburg,
accompanied Count Eberhard of Würtemberg when in the
spring of 1482 he undertook the expedition to Rome, which
will be mentioned hereafter. Marsilio maintained the most
intimate personal relations with Martin Preninger, chancellor
of the bishopric of Constance, and afterwards professor of
canon law at Tübingen. This man was twice in Italy in
the year 1492 on business of Eberhard’s, and his correspondence
with Marsilio bears witness to a friendship and agreement
of opinions rare to meet with. Marsilio was wont to
say that he possessed two friends, one in Germany, the other
in Italy, who represented the alliance between philosophy
and jurisprudence, namely, Martinus Uranius (Preninger’s
literary name) and Giovan Vittorio Soderini. He had Greek
manuscripts copied for his Swabian friend, and kept him
informed of what was going on in the field of science, as well
as of what he was doing himself. Another of his German
correspondents was Georg Herwart of Augsburg, who made
his acquaintance in Florence; Reuchlin’s younger brother
Dionysius and Johann Strehler of Ulm also received introductions
to him, when being sent by the Count of Würtemberg
to study in Italy they enjoyed the notice of Lorenzo de’
Medici and were received into the house of Giorgio Antonio
Vespucci. Numerous princes, temporal and spiritual, beginning
with Matthias Corvinus, who tried vainly to attract
him to Ofen like Argyropulos, were in regular correspondence
with him, asked his advice on points of theology and
philosophy, and sought his criticism on various works.</p>

<p>Amid all these unsought testimonies of honour and confidence,
Marsilio Ficino remained simple, unpretending,
easily satisfied. His delicate health compelled him to lead
a quiet life, and suffices to explain the melancholy humour
that often stole over him when alone. Yet in company
which he liked, and which afforded food for his mind in unrestrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
intercourse, he was cheerful and sympathetic.
His musical talents, bringing change and refreshment from
serious studies, helped to season his conversation. With his
plectrum, an instrument which he himself perfected, he resembled
the poet-sages of the mythic age. He was seldom
absent from Platonic banquets, and had been an habitual
guest of Lorenzo’s grandfather when the latter invited
learned men to his house. He loved a country life above all
things, and passed a great part of his time on the little
estate of Montevecchio. In later years he often went to see
Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano, when they were staying
in his neighbourhood&mdash;the one at Querceto, the other at
Fiesole; and still oftener to Lorenzo, when he was living at
Careggi. He was received as a welcome guest at the villas
of Valori, Canigiani, Cavalcanti, and others. At Montevecchio
he instituted a peculiar yearly festival. On SS.
Cosmo and Damian’s day he assembled the old tenants
(‘coloni’) of his first and greatest patron and entertained
them with music and singing. His independence of mind
was in no way diminished by intercourse with those who,
through birth or a successful career, held a higher position
in life. He once wrote thus to Lorenzo de’ Medici, whose
fondness for pleasure in his earlier, perhaps also in his later
days, appeared to Ficino excessive, and caused him anxiety:
‘In the name of the eternal God I intreat thee, my dearest
Prince, to economise every moment of this brief life, lest
there come over thee vain remorse for dissipation and irreparable
harm. The consciousness of lost time drew deep
sighs from the great Cosimo in my presence, when he had
reached the age of seventy. Trifling occupations and empty
pastimes rob thee of thy true self; they make thee a slave,
who art born to be a ruler. Free thyself while thou canst
from this miserable servitude; only to-day canst thou do so,
for only to-day is thine own; to-morrow it will be too late.’</p>

<p>When the young Raffaelle Riario was made a cardinal,
he addressed to him warnings and counsels similar to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
given in a like case, fourteen years later, by Lorenzo to his
son, who was departing for Rome. He reminded him that,
since he owed his high rank not to his own merits, he was
the more bound to justify by his manner of life the preference
bestowed on him. His memorable appeal to Pope
Sixtus IV. during the war of 1478<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> shows how he could
combine outspokenness with reverence for the head of the
Church, which the Bishop of Arezzo, a far higher dignitary
than he, and Francesco Filelfo made light of. His was the
frankness of a lover of truth whose soul was filled with grief
for the evils which had befallen the flock, and no less for the
blots which in an unhappily complicated affair had fallen on
the reputation of a supreme pastor who ought to be revered
for his wisdom and goodness.</p>

<p>Like a true philosopher, Marsilio Ficino never strove
after outward splendour. His income was most modest.
Besides his little farm, he received from Lorenzo two benefices
of which the revenue was small, as he was obliged to entrust
them to curates, but which would have sufficed for his
modest requirements had he not been besieged in his later
years by a swarm of needy relatives. Without the aid of
rich friends, the publication of his works would have been
impossible. Amid the restlessness and discontent of the
learned men of his time, who were rushing breathlessly after
wealth and honours; amid the greediness for ecclesiastical
benefices, even among those who were not priests like himself,
Marsilio Ficino, contented and devoted to science, is a
fine example of the realisation of those philosophic doctrines
which in the case of so many were only spiritual luxuries or
a means of making money. It is this that gives interest to
his character and work, though his writings have lost their
value except in their connection with the history of learning.
Lorenzo’s attachment to him remained unchanged till his
last hour; it shows itself in his poems as vividly as in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
letters. ‘Write to me,’ he says in a letter addressed to him
from Pisa, about 1473,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ‘whatever occurs to your mind, for
nothing ever comes from you that is not good; you never
have an unworthy thought, so that you can never write me
anything that will not be useful or agreeable. What makes
me long for your letters is that in them you combine elegance
of expression with solidity of contents, so that in both respects
they leave nothing to be desired.’ And in the philosophic
poem mentioned above, on the independence of happiness
from outward position, he thus describes Marsilio’s appearance,
with a touch of the warm feeling that inspired
Dante on meeting his master Brunetto, at the sight of the
‘dear, good, fatherly face:’</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Marsilio is this, of Montevecchio,<br />
Whom heaven has filled with its own special grace,<br />
That to the world its mirror he may be?</p>
<p class="pp6">This is that faithful follower of the Muses,</p>
<p class="pp4">In whom are grace and wisdom aye united,<br />
And never separated one from other;</p>
<p class="pp6">From us and all worthy of highest honour.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Cristoforo Landino stands far below Marsilio Ficino in
scientific importance. But both as a professor and in the
learned circle of the Medici he held a peculiar position; and
by one of his literary works he opened out a path which
hundreds trod after him without taking away the relative
value of his labours. His life was not like that of his contemporary
and friend, dedicated solely to literature. As
Chancellor of the Magistracy of the Guelphic party, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the secretaries of the Republic, he was concerned in public
affairs till a late period of his life.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> During the lifetime of
Pope Eugene IV. he passed some time in Rome, and studied
those antiquities the decay of which made a painful impression
on him, as on other Florentines of his time. But when
complaining, like others, that the travertine of the amphitheatre
is broken up and burnt for chalk, and that the
antique sculptures lie about mutilated, he exaggerates
strangely when he says:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Though round the mighty city thy gaze contemplative wanders,<br />
Vainly around does it look for monuments vanished and gone.</p>

<p class="p1">In January, 1458, he accepted the professorship of
eloquence and poetry at the University, and gathered round
him a continually renewed circle of hearers, his influence
being equalled by that of no contemporary save Ficino. In
1460 he began to lecture on the Italian poems of Petrarca,
being desirous to stem the tide of contempt for the vulgar
tongue which still existed in learned circles. Though in
this respect he deserves all praise, yet his remarks on contemporaries,
on Bruni, Alberti, Palmieri, show how he was
himself still prejudiced in his view of the philological treatment
of the language. His labours in the field of classical
philology have no great weight. He wrote a commentary
on Horace and one on Virgil, the former of which he dedicated
to Guidobaldo of Montefeltro, and the latter to the
young Piero de’ Medici. He also translated Pliny’s ‘Natural
History,’ and undertook translations of modern Italian
works, such as Giovanni Simonetta’s Latin ‘History of Francesco
Sforza,’ which was published at Milan in 1490. He
composed a letter-writer and a formulary for speeches, which
was printed two years later, with a dedication to Duke
Ercole d’Este. But the true centre of his activity and its
importance lies elsewhere&mdash;in his relation to and share in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that intellectual movement amid which the Medici lived, and
in his position as a leader of the revival of the study of
Dante. In illustration of the first point, his ‘Disputationes
Camaldulenses,’ which belong to the history of Lorenzo’s
youth, deserve especial consideration.</p>

<p>Amidst the fir and beech woods which still cover the
Casentino hills, where they rise towards the Apennines, lies
the convent which gave its name to the order of St. Romuald.
For nearly a thousand years countless pilgrims and travellers
have rested within the hospitable walls of Camaldoli, which
now seem threatened with abandonment and desolation. The
Medici had long kept up intimate relations with the Order.
Cosimo and his brother were frequent visitors to the monastery
of the Angeli; and here, in the mother-convent of the
Casentino, Madonna Contessina had built a chapel to the
Baptist. The connection lasted long. Lorenzo’s son
Giovanni dedicated some peaceful days in his youth to contemplation
and prayer here, as did many before and after
him who sat on the chair of St. Peter or were reckoned by
the Church among her saints&mdash;Gregory IX., Eugene IV.,
Paul III., Francis of Assisi, and Charles Borromeo. More
than four centuries ago, there assembled here a select society
composed of elements the most diverse and yet congenial.
Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici came to exchange the noise
and glare of the city for the delicious freshness and solitude
of the woods. Piero and Donato Acciaiuoli, Alamanno
Rinuccini, whose youthful studies had been directed by
Poggio Bracciolini, and who had been one of the best pupils
of Argyropulos, Marco Parenti, and Antonio Canigiani,
accompanied the youths. Cristoforo Landino and his
brother Piero came up from their home in the valley to the
cooler height of the convent, where they also met Leon
Battista Alberti and Ficino. Thus many of the most
eminent men of the Medicean circle assembled round
Lorenzo and Giuliano, who, notwithstanding their youth,
were already accustomed to take part in serious discourse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The abbot, Mariotto Allegri, as host, was the centre of the
circle; but it was Alberti who, with his many-sided knowledge
and easy command of it, gave the tone to the evening’s
discourse.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after the whole company had
assisted at mass in the church of the convent, they all moved
along the pleasant woodland path leading to the summit of
the mountain ridge, past the little group of dwellings and
gardens, the place where, according to the legend, the saint
had a dream which led him to change his black Benedictine
robe for the white one which continued to be worn at
Camaldoli, as it is represented in Andrea Sacchi’s fine picture
at the Vatican. We know not whether the travellers
reached the neighbouring mountain ridge, the watershed of
Italy, whence the eye looks down on Romagna and takes in
the wide sweep of the far-off Adriatic. The narrator makes
the company halt on the height near a spring, under the
shelter of a mighty beech; a tree which, defying the
mountain storms, overtops all other trees on the Apennines,
whose brow it adorns here in the midst of fine pasture lands.
Here Leon Battista, again taking the lead in the conversation,
dilated on the good effects of retirement and meditation
on the mind of the statesman and the scholar, and
showed that only when the mind is set free from contact
with the individual does it become capable of embracing the
whole. Then turning to the two young men the speaker
reminded them that their father’s failing health would
probably soon call them to the guidance of state affairs, which,
he said, were already in some degree entrusted to their
care. After a somewhat extravagant eulogium of Lorenzo’s
qualities, his courage, prudence, and moderation, Alberti
continued to set forth how, notwithstanding such qualities
and the moderate bearing he had hitherto displayed, quiet
meditation or discourse held with a confidential circle on the
deepest questions of human nature could not but be beneficial
to the community. When the learned man thus adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the Platonic principle, according to which complete abstinence
from worldly pursuits brings our nature most surely
to perfection, it would not have been difficult for Lorenzo,
who was already well acquainted with this doctrine, to show
that a man who practically applied and followed this principle
must necessarily be brought into contradiction with his
duties as a citizen; whereas the two phases of our nature&mdash;the
active and the contemplative life&mdash;not divided, but united
and balancing each other, lead to the true fulfilment of the
purpose of existence.</p>

<p>From the objection put into the mouth of the young man
and directed against Landino’s own teaching, as well as from
the praises bestowed on Lorenzo’s conduct, it is clear that
the date of the conversation is shortly before the death of
Piero de’ Medici, when the Pitti transactions had given
evidence of the prudence and talents of his son. The visit
to Camaldoli may have taken place earlier, but the ‘disputations,’
which are the actual conversations expanded and
embellished, were certainly not composed before 1470. In
the discourses of the three following days Alberti again took
the lead, and expounded the connection of the ‘Æneid’ with
Platonic philosophy. What is here said of the character of
Virgil’s poetry, of the ancient wisdom therein, which has
become common property, of the poet’s knowledge and
reverence for antiquity, of the relation between the poetical
garniture and the more solid contents of the work, was
probably drawn from Landino’s own Virgilian studies, for the
author of the book speaks through the mouths of those to
whom he attributes the conversations held in the woods of
Camaldoli. He dedicated his work to Federigo of Montefeltro.
If, as it seems, this dedication to the valiant and
accomplished prince of Urbino was made in 1472, the book
has a certain connection with the sad occurrences at Volterra,
in which Lorenzo de’ Medici’s action belied only too
strongly the Platonic theory of wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>If Cristoforo Landino is ever mentioned nowadays, it is
only on account of his studies of Dante, which constitute his
only value in the eyes of posterity. The study of the ‘Divine
Comedy’ went through the most varied phases in Florence as
elsewhere. On the petition of divers citizens (see above,
vol. i. p. 80) in 1373, fifty-two years after Dante’s death,
the Republic decreed the establishment of public lectures on
his great poem.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On Sunday, October 3, in the church of
Sto. Stefano, Giovanni Boccaccio began the lectures, the
interruption of which by his death shortly after was lamented
by Francesco Sacchetti. Messer Antonio, priest of
Vado, and Filippo Villani succeeded him. A mass of commentaries
were composed almost immediately after the poet’s
own time, partly by his own friends. Numerous copies of
the poem were in circulation; that which was formerly in the
library of the convent of Sta. Croce, and is now in the
Laurentiana, was attributed to Filippo Villani. Most of
these copies were faulty. ‘I am trying,’ wrote Coluccio
Salutati to Niccolò of Todi, at the beginning of the fifteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> ‘to get a correct copy of the work of our divine
Dante. Believe me, we possess nothing more sublime than
these three poems, nothing more richly adorned, nothing
more carefully worked out, nothing which penetrates further
into the depths of knowledge. What only comes to others
in part this one man has mastered as a whole. His moral
precepts are sublime; he throws light on natural history and
theology, and his masterly handling of language and rhetoric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
is such that it would be difficult to find equal beauty of style
even in the greatest writers. With him the laws, manners,
tongues, the history of all nations, shine like stars in the firmament
with such majesty that no one can equal him in this
respect, far less surpass him. Wherefore do I say all this?
That my eagerness to obtain a correct text may cause thee
less astonishment.’</p>

<p>This enthusiasm for Dante&mdash;an enthusiasm which one
cannot but feel was less for the poet than for the man who
had mastered more than any other all the learning of his
time&mdash;was, however, by no means shared by all the learned
men of the fifteenth century, whose threshold Coluccio barely
crossed. Niccolò Niccoli, by his attacks on his great countryman,
exposed himself to obloquy from which he never
recovered; though it must not be forgotten that the words
in which Niccoli calls Dante’s book reading for cobblers and
bakers are only found in a writing of Leonardo Bruni, who
was just as excitable as Niccoli himself. Niccoli’s rage seems
to have been especially excited by the unclassical Latin in
Dante’s letters; but the reproach which he brings against
Dante, that he knew nothing of classical literature, and drew
all his information from monkish compendiums&mdash;a reproach
which, strangely enough, he also applies to Petrarca and
Boccaccio<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;resembles other tokens of the pride of the humanistic
school too strongly to be seriously examined. The
lecture given at the end of 1430 by Francesco Filelfo against
the censurers of Dante, and the controversial treatise composed
for the same object by Cino Rinuccini, father of
Alamanno, are sufficiently clear proofs how false was the
judgment of many. Filelfo himself declared, more than
forty years later, that he undertook the public exposition of
the ‘Divine Comedy’ of his own accord, and in deference to a
general wish.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> About the close of the fourteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Filippo Villani wrote a short life of Dante; a longer
biography came out in 1436 written by Leonardo Bruni;
twenty years later he was followed by Gianozzo Manetti.
Not long after the latter, Gian Maria Filelfo, Francesco’s
son, who had many opportunities of acquiring information
from the poet’s descendants living in Verona, wrote a new
biography which he dedicated to Pietro Alighieri, and which
the latter sent, at the end of 1467, to Piero de’ Medici and
Tommaso Soderini.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The erection in Sta. Maria del Fiore of a
monument in the shape of the poet’s statue was decreed in
1465. Ten years later, the picture painted by Domenico di
Michelino was placed in the north aisle of the church.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In
literature the great poet’s countrymen had wandered far
away from the path which he had pointed out; but they
guarded his memory faithfully, and the beautiful manuscripts
which appeared about the middle of the fifteenth century,
shortly before the introduction of printing, prove how much
his work was held in honour.</p>

<p>In 1472 a German named Johann Numeister (Neumeister),
and a native of Fuligno, printed the ‘Divine Comedy’ for
the first time in that Umbrian city.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Other impressions at
Mantua, Jesi, and other places were followed in 1477 by the
first edition at Venice, with a commentary of the fourteenth
century. At last, after Florence had allowed nine editions
to take precedence of her, the first Florentine edition
appeared in the summer of 1481, with the glosses of Cristoforo
Landino. A Silesian named Nicolaus (Niccolò di Lorenzo
della Magna) had the honour of presenting to the poet’s
native city the text of his work, accompanied by the commentary
in smaller type, in a form highly creditable to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
still youthful art. The Magliabecchian library possesses the
copy, printed on parchment, which Landino presented to
the Signoria, with a speech which also appeared in print.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Rich miniatures at the beginning, arabesque borders, a
medallion portrait of Dante, and on the binding, striped with
the Florentine colours, red and white, niello-work representing
the lion and Hercules, the seal of the commonwealth,
with the lily-shield and that of the red cross, show with what
pretensions this edition came forth. By a decree of somewhat
tardy justice the Republic reinstated the exile of 1301
in his civil rights and honours, and placed his statue,
crowned with laurel, in the baptistery of San Giovanni. In
a Latin address Ficino set forth the rejoicings of Florence at
the restoration of his honour by the hands of one of his
fellow-citizens; and Benivieni celebrated in harmonious terza
rima the fulfilment of the prophecy in which the exile predicted
his future fame, and his ultimate return to his ungrateful
city:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">With other voice forthwith, with other fleece,<br />
Poet will I return, and at my font<br />
Baptismal will I take the laurel crown.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The Signoria showed itself grateful to Landino. It gave
him a tower on the ramparts of Borgo alia Collina, where he
dwelt, and its possession was confirmed to his descendants
in 1563 by a sentence of the supreme civil court of Florence,
the Rota, when the magistrates of the Parte Guelfa claimed
it as public property. His work is not remarkable for critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thoroughness and correctness, but for the commentary, which
had great influence on opinion at the time and long afterwards.
Six if not seven reissues in different places before the end of
the century show with what approval this edition was
received. It encountered formidable rivals, with respect to
the text, in 1502, in the first Aldine, and with respect to the
commentary in 1544, in Alessandro Vellutello’s work, which
was soon followed by others; yet it retains some value even
now. While Landino was earning well-deserved fame by
this fruit of diligent study, the lectures in the cathedral on
the ‘Divine Comedy’ were entrusted, in 1483, to the preaching
friar Domenico da Corella, who had taken part in the
council, and dedicated his Latin poem on the life of the
Virgin Theotokon to Piero de’ Medici in 1468. Marsilio
Ficino had long previously turned his attention to Dante
when he dedicated his translation of the ‘De Monarchia’ in
1467 to his friends Bernardo del Nero and Antonio Manetti.
The latter, who occupied himself much with copying old
codices, is remembered among students of Dante by his
dialogue (between himself and Benivieni) on the position,
form, and extent of hell. Marsilio’s dedication states that
he had held much discourse with the two men named on the
questions raised by this political treatise, and that they were
thereby led to discuss the ‘Divina Commedia.’ As Dante
treated in his poem of the kingdom of the blessed, of the
regions of the wretched, and of the place where departed
souls abide waiting for redemption, so in his book on
monarchy he treated of the realms of those who are still
waiting and hoping in this world. The perception, imperfect
though it be, of the spiritual connection between the great
poem and its author’s other works, shows a progress in the
appreciation of Dante remarkable at the time, and to this
Cristoforo Landino had practically contributed.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s great interest in the most sublime poet of the
middle ages is shown both by testimonies in his own writings
and by a letter written to him, April 13, 1476, by the above-named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Antonio Manetti, then governor of the small town of
San Giovanni, in the Val d’Arno. This letter<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> shows that
Lorenzo had come to an understanding with the Venetian
ambassador, Bernardo Bembo, for the purpose of soliciting
from the senate of that Republic the return of Dante’s mortal
remains from Ravenna to Florence. ‘Magnificent Lord,’&mdash;thus
the letter begins&mdash;‘I am told that the Venetian ambassador
has returned home. Remembering what you once
told me, as we returned from visiting him shortly after
Matteo Palmieri’s funeral, when we were near the house of
Antonio Pucci, I wish you would bring that matter to a
conclusion. I know not what greater pleasure I could have
in my life than to witness the return of those remains which
the magnificent ambassador promised to obtain when he
went back to his own country; the more so as I am sure
that, with your greatness and magnanimity, you will do whatever
is in your power to give to the remains of such a man
the reception they deserve, as to sepulture and crown. Great
acts are for the magnanimous; but what could be greater
than this? I commend myself to your Magnificence. May
the Lord be with you.’</p>

<p>Twice already, in 1396 and 1426, when the Polenta
family, which had offered hospitality to the exiled poet, was
still reigning at Ravenna, the Florentines had tried to get
back his remains. But both times they failed; and they
had no better luck in 1476, nor again under the reign of
Leo X., when Michael Angelo offered to raise the monument
to his great countryman, whom he resembled in more
respects than one. Seven years after the date of Antonio
Manetti’s letter, Bernardo Bembo, when Podestà at Ravenna,
caused Dante’s sepulchre to be restored. He had been too
rash in the promise given to Lorenzo de’ Medici, but he did
all that lay in his power to honour the memory of the father
of Italian poetry.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">An</span> influence hardly less important than that of the philosophers
and grammarians was exercised on Lorenzo and his
epoch by the literary innovators who, with some infusion of
classic learning, were not so pedantic as the early humanists,
while they bore the impress of the teaching of the preceding
century. The Medici were to these men of letters, just as
much as they were to the philosophers, the centre to which
their several rays converged, and Lorenzo’s name is inseparable
from the names of several among them. One in
this brilliant circle holds a different position from the rest.
He took as a poet the part which Landino took as a critic
in the revival of the study of Dante. Matteo Palmieri holds
a place by himself. The first glance into his great poem,
the ‘City of Life,’ (‘Città di Vita’) shows it to be an imitation
of the ‘Divine Comedy;’ but only in the outward form.
It is a philosophical work, the object of which is to describe
and correct the problems and abuses of citizen life. It contains
no real poetry, but has the merit of popularising the
doctrines of moral philosophy in language somewhat lifeless,
indeed, yet expressive, comparatively pure, and free from
the philological follies of the age. The book became known
only within a narrow circle. Theological criticism discovered
in it the heretical doctrine of the transmigration of souls,
which indeed Alamanno Rinuccini avowed without scruple
in his funeral oration on the poet, and the work was suppressed.
In later years the author wrote an unfinished history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the world, and a life of the grand seneschal Nicola
Acciaiuolo. He had been a pupil of Traversari and Marsuppini,
had held important offices of state, and after fulfilling
several embassies with honour, died at a ripe age in
1475.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>While this faint echo of Dante was addressing itself to
the higher classes, and proving how large was the retrogression
from the beginning of the fourteenth to the middle of the
fifteenth century, the popular poetry, of which the religious
side has been already noticed, began to sound a natural strain
in a lighter style. Burlesque, which belonged to the character
of the people, was allowed considerable play. The sonnets
that came forth from the barber’s shop of Domenico, called
‘Burchiello,’ in the very heart of old Florence, the Calimala,
and the market, enjoy a reputation that must be taken on
trust. They were chiefly experiments in the Florentine
vulgar tongue&mdash;full of allusions and trivialities; but occasionally
they take a flight which may serve to throw light on
social and political matters, if all the writings attributed to
this man, who died at Rome in 1448, are really by him.
Another burlesque poet, Matteo Franco, whom we shall
meet again, belonged to Lorenzo de’ Medici’s household, and
used to hold with other poets, particularly with Luigi Pulci,
satirical and not always very seemly sham-fights as a social
pastime. But far more important for this period was the
rise of a new style which was destined to give to the sixteenth
century its special poetic character. Of the brothers
Pulci, scions of an old family somewhat reduced in circumstances,
one, Bernardo, tried his hand both as an original
writer and a translator of eclogues; the two others are among
the cultivators of the poetry of chivalry, which began its
course as a branch of literature under their auspices. Both
Luca and Luigi belong to the immediate Medicean circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Luca Pulci, the eldest brother, born at Florence in 1431, is
commonly designated as the author of the poem on Lorenzo
de’ Medici’s tournament, which only retains a place in
literature because it records an event in the life of a celebrated
man. But the assumption of this authorship is by
no means certain, for the first edition bears the name of
Luigi Pulci, whose literary fame it would not enhance. That
Luca was intimate with the young Medici is shown by the
fact that at their desire he began the poem ‘Ciriffo Calvaneo,’
which two generations later was partially continued by
Bernardo Giambullari for another Lorenzo, grandson of
the Magnificent. It is a poetical version of a popular
romance of chivalry, which in its Italian form bears the title
of the ‘Povero Avveduto,’ and relates the battles and adventures
of the time of King Louis d’Outre-mer of France, in
921-954.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Luca Pulci, after some unlucky banking affairs at
Rome and Florence, died in 1470, in the debtors’ prison of
the Stinche, and left to his brothers the burden of a large
family. He was, as we have said, the eldest of the brothers;
but it is probable that his ‘Ciriffo’ was preceded by Luigi’s
‘Morgante.’ We are led to assume this by the fact that
Luigi chose a far better subject.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> His poem must have been
written in and after 1460, and the cantos must have followed
close upon each other. We learn from the author himself that
its original conception was due in part to Lorenzo’s mother.
In a letter addressed by him to Lorenzo from Fuligno, December
4, 1470, he held out prospects of a new heroic poem.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a serious and pious woman like Madonna Lucrezia should be
patroness of a work more or less offensive in a religious
point of view may be matter of surprise. But after making
allowance for the tendencies of the time, which saw no harm
in a mixture of religion and burlesque, and, amid the strictest
devotional practices, treated questions of faith with incredible
unceremoniousness, it must be remembered that this lady
was wont for the sake of genius to judge leniently many
things in literature and in life that were questionable. Thus
she remained a supporter of Angelo Poliziano after he had
fallen into disgrace with her daughter-in-law, and presented
him with her religious poems when the unfavourable
rumours as to his faith and morals could be no secret to
her. But Luigi Pulci, the free-thinker and loose mocker,
who mixed up quotations from St. John’s Gospel with open
expressions of unbelief, found in her an active and zealous
friend till her life’s close.</p>

<p>The ‘Morgante Maggiore’ was the beginning of the
romantic epopee, which successfully laid hold of the cycle of
Carolingian legends that had been rendered accessible to
the Italian nation by the ‘Chronicle’ of Turpin and the book
of the ‘Reali di Francia.’ This choice of a subject was all the
happier because Florence attributed her restoration to Charlemagne,
as may be read carved in stone in the church of the
Apostles. The style of the work is original. Amid all its
prodigies the old knightly romance is serious and full of
faith. Christianity is always the foil to the chivalry which
sprang from it, and which is animated by its spirit. ‘Morgante’
(the story takes its name from the giant who accomplishes
his strange exploits) is not a satire on chivalry, but
it is so saturated with burlesque that it assumes a very
peculiar character. Neither is it a denial of Christianity,
from which, on the contrary, it derives here and there a
deeply religious tone; but it is Christianity struggling with
scepticism and denial, so that the faith of the Church and
the people is driven into the background. In this respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
‘Morgante’ is a true mirror of the time. With its perfect
command of the subject, bound down to no poetical rules or
precedents, it is a mixture of seriousness and irony, Christianity
and unbelief, Biblical texts and profane witticisms.
It is full of the most glaring contrasts of sound common-sense
and folly, of elegance and coarseness, of lofty intellectual
flights and mere buffoonery. There is in this poem
more richness of imagination and spontaneity than perhaps
in any other work before the appearance of the ‘Orlando
Furioso;’ passages occur full of the deepest pathos, and
showing a feeling that belongs only to a real poet&mdash;passages
too often followed by a grotesqueness that tends to destroy
their effect. The qualities here united in very unequal
degrees were developed and discriminated by later poets.
The importance of Luigi Pulci lies less in his poem, which
falls short of perfection in every way, than in the fact that
his work contains the germs of the romantic epopee in all
its various branches. In considering that the two parent
poems of chivalry in Italian, the ‘Morgante’ and ‘Ciriffo,’
originated in the Medicean house, let it be remembered how
much this branch of poetry, up to the ‘Jerusalem Delivered,’
with which it terminates, was connected with that Court life
which is so constantly represented in its varied productions.
From the household of Cosimo, Piero, and Lorenzo de’ Medici,
who at the highest pinnacle of their fame did not abandon
the simplicity and comfort of free citizen life, to the ceremonious
Court of Alfonso of Este, is certainly a very long
step. Though the Pulci did not go so far as to weave into their
ottava rima a genealogy of their patrons reaching back to
demigods, still theirs was a kind of poetry destined to
enliven stately banquets.</p>

<p>Luigi Pulci’s intimacy with Lorenzo is shown by his oft-quoted
letters, which throw some side-lights on the various
relations between patron and client, and on the commissions,
rather political than literary, entrusted to the latter. The
author of ‘Morgante’ was sincerely attached to his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
patron. When the latter was going to Southern Italy in
1466, before the Neroni and Pitti conspiracy, Pulci wrote to
him from the convent of Alverina:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> ‘Dost thou really mean
to leave me buried in the snow among these woods, lonely
and comfortless, while thou goest to Rome? Is it really my
fate that, whatever thou mayest think of me, as the climax of
my ill-luck, I must never mount a horse by thy side? Am I
to come to that only when I am an old man? How often
have we talked about Rome, and now shall I not accompany
thee?&mdash;can it be because I should increase the expenses of
the journey? Let not that trouble thee; amid all my
troubles I will yet do thee credit. A horse is all I ask of
thee; for I shall find so many friends yonder, and will
manage so well, that I will not be a burthen to thee, as perhaps
thou fearest. Truly thou art wrong to pass me by, not
to mention that it would hurt me more than anything in
this world. Do not treat me as if I were old iron, for I shall
soon be well if thou carest for me.’ And Lorenzo really did
care for him. Two years later Pulci wrote to him from
Pisa: ‘If thou dost not wish people to believe or know that
I am thy friend, and have some influence with thee, placard
it on the walls&mdash;at thine own expense, of course; as for
some time past having had no money to pay away, I have
been paying with thy name instead. Wherever I show
myself people whisper, “That is Lorenzo’s great friend.”’
That Pulci’s money matters were not in brilliant order we
have already seen. His brother’s business misfortunes
brought him into great difficulties. ‘Never yet have I made
a plan,’ he wrote to Lorenzo after Luca’s failure, ‘that Fate
did not destroy in an hour what I had taken a year to build
up. I must have come into the world like hares and other
poor animals, doomed to be the prey of the huntsman. It is
my fate to love thee, and to be very little in thy company.’
That the Medicean bank helped him out, but that the loans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were very unimportant and notorious besides, we learn
from a petition dated from his estate at Mugello, May 14,
1479, to the effect that Lorenzo would grant him a longer
delay for the repayment of a hundred gold florins. He was
evidently included in the measures which were rendered
necessary by the bad state of the Medicean finances at that
time. Pulci, who among others was very intimate with the
Sanseverini, seems to have been employed by Lorenzo
especially at Naples, Bologna, and Milan, both before and
after this period. The last of the poet’s letters known to
us, written from Verona, August 28, 1484, shows him to us
in the suite of Roberto da Sanseverino and his son Fracasso,
who were on their way to Venice. He died in Padua
shortly after, but nothing is known about his death.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Luigi Pulci was about seventeen years older than his
princely friend Lorenzo de’ Medici, while the man who
entered into the closest and most productive intellectual
relations with Lorenzo was a few years his junior. In 1464
a boy of ten came to Florence to seek maintenance and instruction
in the house of some not very wealthy relatives.
He had been rendered fatherless by one of those tragedies
which bring to light and stigmatise the wild passions and
party hatred that in the Tuscan communes of the fifteenth
century mocked at justice, and which, though so fearful in
punishment, was so powerless for the protection of the citizens.
Benedetto Ambrogini of Montepulciano, a jurist of a not
undistinguished family, who had held civil and judicial
offices at home and abroad, had in the previous year applied
to Piero de’ Medici<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for protection against the bloodthirsty
enmity of fellow-citizens and neighbours, to which he soon
after fell a victim, leaving unprovided a widow with five
children, of whom the above-named boy was the eldest.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Angelo, who took from his birthplace the name of Poliziano,
early became acquainted with the serious side of life; for
although as a child he showed brilliant talents and made
rapid progress, he was in danger of being compelled to seek
a living as assistant in a shop, and of renouncing the studies
to which he was ardently devoted. At fifteen he expressed
this tormenting dread in a Latin poem addressed to the
young but celebrated philologer, Bartolommeo Fonte, who at
that time assisted him with guidance and encouragement.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In the year 1469-70 he studied at the Florentine university,
and at seventeen he wrote Greek epigrams. He had the
privilege of listening to the men who kept alive the traditions
of the university’s best days, Argyropulos and Andronikos
Kallistos, Landino and Ficino. That polite literature
attracted him more than philosophical lectures he declares
himself, saying that he had done with philosophy as dogs
with the Nile: one drink, and then away! ‘Nature and
youth drew me to Homer, and with all the zeal and industry
of which I was capable I set myself to translate him into
Latin verse.’ In one of the earliest, if not the very earliest,
of his Latin poems, the distichs addressed to Lorenzo de’
Medici in commendation of his master Kallistos, he sets
forth how the latter was reading the Trojan war in Argive
verse. In this poem he alludes to the time when he hopes
to sing the deeds of Lorenzo, then limited to youthful
exercises, and his adroit conduct in the matter of the Pitti
conspiracy, which Poliziano commemorates in a later elegy.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It must have been about 1470 that he began to translate
the ‘Iliad.’ Carlo Marsuppini had translated the first book;
Angelo began with the second. It was a great undertaking
for a young man. A Latin Homer had been the <i>in votis</i> up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to that time; and now the work was begun by one who had
but just entered the world and was still unknown, but who
displayed an ease and grace of diction, melodiousness and
richness of versification, that caused general surprise. This
work and the admiration it excited opened the Medicean
house to the young poet. It was probably Ficino who recommended
the ‘Homeric youth’ to Lorenzo. The young
head of the house, who had only become independent the
year before, took him up; and whatever changes outward
and inward occurred in Lorenzo’s life, the man who owed his
brilliant endowments to Heaven, and their early and happy recognition
to him kept faithful; he stood beside his patron’s
death-bed and ere long followed him to the tomb. The dedication
of the second book contains praises of the generous protector&mdash;praises
lavish according to custom, but not untrue if
the custom and the glory with which the young ruler of
Florence had surrounded himself be taken into consideration.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
A troop of panegyrists followed, Marsilio Ficino at their head.
There was no lack of exaggeration. The head of the Platonists
raised a flattering doubt whether any one could discover
if the Greek or the Latin text of this Iliad was the original;
another asked who had the greatest merit, he who had given
occasion for the undertaking, or he who had accomplished it.
Meanwhile the translator went on with his work; and when,
two years after the completion of the second book, he presented
the third to his patron, he expressed a hope that after
finishing the whole he might begin an epic poem on a subject
taken from Lorenzo’s own life, the war of Volterra. The
‘Iliad’ was never finished, the epic was never written.
Lorenzo, who knew the world much better than did Angelo,
probably objected to the glorification of an expedition of
questionable prowess and of unquestionable barbarity. In
like manner, when his son Leo was raised to the cardinalate,
he disapproved of the eulogium which Poliziano addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the Pope. When Poliziano described the most important
and dramatic event of his patron’s life, the conspiracy of the
Pazzi, it was in prose.</p>

<p>The man who had received the young poet into his house
and enabled him to give all his time to study was doubtless
also the cause of his sending a specimen of his work to Cardinal
Ammanati, who kept up such intimate relations with
the Medici. Poliziano’s address to this Prince of the Church<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
was modest. He wrote that he was doing like the eagle,
which carries its young as soon as they are out of the shell
into the light of the rising sun, that their eyes may become
accustomed to its splendour. The cardinal, in whom survived
the humanistic tradition of the days of Pius II., returns him
phrase for phrase without offending against truth. The
verses were wonderfully harmonious for so young a writer;
the enterprise was useful as an introduction to great things.
But if Homer could be asked whether he wished to be turned
into Latin, he feared that the old poet, feeling the impossibility
of a perfect rendering, would prefer to remain a citizen
of Kolophon rather than become a Florentine, and would
consider the pallium a more suitable vesture than the toga.
In 1473, our poet had addressed some verses full of sonorous
but very ordinary flattery to the spendthrift Cardinal of San
Sisto, Pietro Riario, on the occasion of his appointment to
the archbishopric of Florence. Instead of the expected present,
he was put off with fine speeches, and, after the fashion of
poor poets, complained bitterly.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>About this time, also, he was rewarded with nothing
but words by another cardinal, a very different man from
Riario. He must have said to himself that the days of
Nicholas V. were over, although Sixtus IV. hardly yielded
to him in his zeal for collecting books. He never seems to
have become acquainted with the Pope, and the disagreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which gradually arose between the latter and Poliziano’s
protector deprived him of all opportunity of doing so. Four
books of the translation of Homer are in existence;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> whether
the work proceeded further is uncertain. It was twice interrupted,
and the second interruption decided its fate. Poliziano
may, in the progress of his studies, have come round to
the views of the Cardinal of Pavia, and have doubted whether
a Latinity which strove after the elegance of the Augustan
age was suited to the old Greek epic.</p>

<p>The first short interruption was a journey to Mantua with
Cardinal Francesco da Gonzaga, in August 1472. The intimate
relations between the Gonzaga and the Medici, which
corresponded to those between the Marquis Lodovico and the
city of Florence, have been already spoken of. Francesco
took the youthful poet with him from the Medici house.
Poliziano, then aged eighteen, had already given proof of
uncommon talent on the occasion of a visit to his native city,
where his arrival was celebrated with brilliant festivities.
Here originated the drama of ‘Orpheus,’ which made an epoch
in literature, less by its actual merit than as the first example
of a profane drama in the Italian tongue. Mysteries had
long been popular; the modern drama, even when treating
modern historical subjects, still more when, as in the works
of Alberti and Gregorio Correr, it was directly modelled on
the antique, had always adhered to the Latin language. In
a letter to one of the cardinal’s suite, Messer Carlo Canale
(who was, it may be mentioned, the second or third husband
of the mother of Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia), the author
states that ‘Orpheus’ was composed in two days, amid constant
noisy distractions, and that it was written in the vulgar
tongue in order to be more intelligible to the hearers&mdash;‘an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
imperfect work, fitted to bring its father shame rather than
honour, and worthy of the fate prepared by the Lacedæmonians
for children born weakly or crippled.’ This ‘favola’ is
not a drama; it is a succession of lyrical pieces, with an ode
inserted in Latin Sapphics, in praise of the cardinal, which
Baccio Ugolini, another member of the Medicean circle and
of Landino’s school, sang to the lyre in the character of
‘Orpheus.’<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The Mantuan journey was a short episode. Some smaller
Latin poems, including the beautiful and pathetic elegy on
the death of Albiera degli Albizzi, the charming bride of
Sigismondo della Stufa, in 1473, kept Poliziano in the same
mood, and cannot fairly be considered as interruptions to his
Homeric work. A longer interruption was caused by Giuliano
de’ Medici’s tournament, which was a challenge to Angelo
to write the fairest flower in his poetic garland.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He himself
alludes to this interruption in the seventh stanza of the
‘Giostra:’</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">E se qual fu la fama, il ver rimbomba,</p>
<p class="pp6">Che d’Hecuba la figlia, o sacro Achille,<br />
Poi che ‘l corpo lasciasti entro la tomba,<br />
T’accenda ancor d’amorose faville,<br />
Lascia un poco tacer tua maggior tromba,<br />
Ch’io fo squillar per l’italice ville.<br />
E tempra tu la cetra a’ nuovi carmi,<br />
Mentr’io canto l’amor di Giulio e l’armi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The subject in itself is poor. The author must have felt
this, even had he not been warned by Luca Pulci’s verses on
the tournament of Lorenzo. The ‘Stanzas’&mdash;the title by which
Poliziano’s poem is best known&mdash;are counted among the
gems of Italian literature. They were the first of the kind
expressing real melody without artificiality, being remarkable
for their artistic flow and carefulness of composition.
But for a few harsh and ignoble expressions, they have never
since been surpassed in point of form, though Ariosto may
have more variety and freedom of movement, and Tasso more
harmony. But how do these beautiful stanzas of ottava rima
treat their subject? In the first book it is left altogether
out of sight. The tournament gives place to mythology, the
Piazza Sta. Croce to the gardens and palace of Venus. All
the flowers and trees of the most highly-favoured climates,
all animals of the chase and the peaceful park, the whole of
Olympus, are introduced; reminiscences of all the classic
poets from Lucretius to Claudian, even to the Christian
singers, wanderings of an exuberant fancy through the
realms of beauty and love,&mdash;all these combine and disport
themselves in such perfect freedom, that it matters not
whether they have anything to do with the subject or not.
At the beginning of the second book the poet seems at last
to bethink himself that he intended to sing the praises of a
Medici. He therefore makes Cupid relate to Venus the glories
of the Tuscan race, and begins with the preparations for great
deeds which such vast mythological machinery demands. The
youth is awakened and armed, but not without assistance from
Olympus. The poem breaks off abruptly, and in its closing
stanzas there gleams a sad presentiment of the cruel fate
which was so soon to put an end to a life apparently destined to
glory and happiness, and with it to a work already highly
valued as a fragment, and which gave the tone to the poetry
of the age just beginning. Who shall say whether it was
not well for the poem that it remained a fragment? for the
disproportion between the unimportance of the subject and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the pomp of the treatment might have come out too strikingly
had it been continued. This poem, intended to celebrate
the acts of Giuliano, is addressed to his brother. The
dedicatory stanza speaks of Lorenzo without circumlocution
as the ruler of Florence:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">High-born Lorenzo, laurel<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> in whose shade<br />
Thy Florence rests nor fears the lowering storm,<br />
Nor threatening signs in heaven’s high front displayed,<br />
Nor Jove’s dread anger in its fiercest form;<br />
O to the trembling Muse afford thine aid&mdash;<br />
The Muse that courts thee timorous and forlorn,<br />
Lives in the shadow of thy prosperous tree,<br />
And bounds her every fond desire to thee.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Angelo Poliziano continued to write Latin verses. His
epigrams, odes, and elegies are valuable both as conveying
a knowledge of the persons and tendencies of a memorable
period, and as proofs of a versatility and classical spirit to
be found in none of his contemporaries and in few subsequent
writers. The philologers of the fifteenth century wrote Latin
verses with ease; but the only poet among them is Poliziano.
His works abound in imitations of all kinds, as do those of
the later Roman poets. But Poliziano feels, thinks, and
writes like a Roman; if not like a poet of the Augustan age,
at least like one of the time of Statius, whom he resembles
in more ways than one, having written ‘Sylvæ’ like him. He
is more classical than some of those who are included in the
ranks of the poets of antiquity.</p>

<p>A peculiar grace, fulness of thought, and great variety,
give to his poems a charm not often found in modern Latin
verses, which seldom display a living individuality. To
descriptions of modern life and modern localities, whose very
names seem unsuitable to a classic sphere, he can give a
native classical colouring, without any apparent effort, yet
with the most consummate art. Most remarkable among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his writings, by its grace and naturalness and an intermingling
of joy and sadness, is the elegy on a bunch of
violets given him by a beloved hand; a poem which, in the
sixteenth century and in our own, has been an object of study
to the choice spirits who wish to acquire pure classic inspiration
in a modern form.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Poliziano here challenges a comparison
with Lorenzo de’ Medici, who treated the same
subject in two of his loveliest sonnets. The ‘Sylvæ,’ poems
of Angelo’s later years, from 1482 to 1486, added to his
reputation, though in happy turns of thought and warmth
of feeling they are inferior to many of his smaller pieces.
They are four poems in heroic metre, prolusions to his philological
lectures at the Florence University, to a chair in
which he was appointed on December 23, 1485, the degree
of Doctor of Common Law being conferred on him by
Archbishop Rinaldo Orsini at his palace, in the presence of
Lorenzo’s son Piero.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The first of these poems,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> ‘Manto’
(the name of the Theban prophetess, which was assumed by
the Italian city founded by her son), treats of Virgil, his
works, his place in literature, his importance for all time.</p>

<p>As the first of the ‘Sylvæ’ was intended as an introduction
to Virgil’s ‘Bucolics,’ so the second, ‘Rusticus,’ was to
serve the same purpose for the ‘Georgics,’ and for the works
and times of Hesiod. The third, ‘Ambra,’ took its name
from the Medicean Poggio a Cajano, but the name has little
connection with the poem, which refers to localities only at
its close, and is devoted to an analysis of Homeric plays regarded
from a pseudo-Herodotean and pseudo-Plutarchian point of
view. The last and longest of the ‘Sylvæ,’ bearing the strange
title of ‘Nutricia: the Reward of the Nursing-mother,’
describes the origin, progress, and influence of the poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and the poetics of classical times, passes on to the author of
the ‘Divine Comedy,’ and ends by singing the praises of
Cosimo de’ Medici and his successors. The abundance and
versatility of Lorenzo’s talents were perhaps never more
truly and happily expressed than in the closing verses of this
poem; and when the praises of living and powerful men
appear in such a setting as this, we may accept them without
complaining. After describing his labours in the field of
sentimental poetry, to which belong the greater part of
Lorenzo’s earlier poems, his other poetical productions and
his whole intellectual character are thus spoken of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Non vacat argutosque sales, Satyraque bibaces<br />
Descriptos memorare senes, non carmina festis<br />
Excipienda choris, querulasve animantia chordas.<br />
Idem etiam tacitæ referens pastoria vitæ<br />
Otia, et urbanos thyrso extimulante labores,<br />
Mox fugis in cœlum, non seu per lubrica nisus<br />
Extremamque boni gaudes contingere metam.<br />
Quodque alii studiumque vocant, durumque laborem,<br />
Hic tibi ludus erit, fessus civilibus actis,<br />
Huc is emeritas acuens ad carmina vires.<br />
Felix ingenio, felix cui pectore tantas<br />
Instaurare vices, cui fas tam magna capaci<br />
Alternare animo, et varias ita nectere curas.</p>

<p class="p1">Poliziano wrote the ‘Nutricia’ in October 1486, at the villa
of Fiesole. In the following verses he prophesied of the
times to come and the future greatness of his pupil, Piero,
if the latter, fulfilling the bright promise of his youth, should
walk in the footsteps of his father:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">It jam pene prior, sic, ô sic pergat, et ipsum<br />
Me superet majore gradu, longeque relinquat<br />
Protinus, et dulci potius plaudatur alumno,<br />
Bisque mei victor illo celebrentur honores.</p>

<p class="p1">A merciful fate spared the poet from witnessing the
failure of hopes the fulfilment of which had already become
very doubtful when he was prematurely called away. Anyone
versed in the history of those days who may now climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the pleasant heights of Fiesole, which new buildings and
roads have altered but not transformed, will think with
interest of Angelo’s abode here in the country-house of the
Medici, which he describes in a letter to Marsilio Ficino.
‘If the summer heat oppress thee at Careggi, the cooler air of
Fiesole will be pleasant to thee. We have plenty of water
between the slopes of the hill, and while gentle winds constantly
refresh us, the glare of the sun troubles us little.
During the ascent to the villa it appears enclosed in trees,
but the spot, when reached, commands an extensive view as
far as the town. The neighbourhood is thickly inhabited,
yet I find here the quiet which suits me. But I will tempt
thee with yet another attraction. Pico sometimes wanders
beyond the limits of his own grounds, breaks in unexpectedly
upon my solitude, and carries me away from my shady
gardens to his evening meal. You know how things are
there; no superfluities, but everything as it should be, and
with the spice of his conversation. But thou must be my
guest; with me thou shalt find as good a table and perhaps
better wine, for Pico and I are rivals in respect to wine.’<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The ‘Sylvæ’ are dedicated to three young men belonging
to the Medicean circle and one who stood outside it. Lorenzo&mdash;the
son of Pier Francesco de’ Medici, grandson of Cosimo’s
brother&mdash;whose name stands at the beginning of ‘Manto,’ was
at that time on friendly terms with the members of the elder
branch of his race. He afterwards became estranged from
them; a change the effects of which did not cease when his
posterity had entered upon the dominion of Florence, and the
last remaining descendant of Cosimo’s line sat on the throne
of France. Gifted with poetical talents, and no unworthy
rival of his more famous relatives, the younger Lorenzo was
a friend of Poliziano’s, who dedicated to him among other
things a description of the <i>villeggiatura</i> at Poggio a Cajano.
‘Rusticus’ was intended for Jacopo Salviati, who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
these verses were written, in 1483, had been designated as
Lorenzo’s son-in-law; so that Poliziano, who had first sung
the praises of the unlucky Archbishop of Pisa and then
openly insulted him with extravagant accusations, passed
lightly over the troublesome past. ‘Ambra’ was sent to
Lorenzo Tornabuoni, son of Giovanni, and for a time a pupil,
together with Piero de’ Medici, of our poet, who in one of
his letters praised his intellectual gifts and knowledge of
classical literature. He was a faithful adherent of his relatives,
not only in prosperity but also in adversity, which fell
on him even more heavily than on them. In the days of
Savonarola he was accused of taking part in a conspiracy in
favour of the exiles, and, with Niccolò Ridolfi, the father of
Lorenzo’s son-in-law, suffered on the scaffold in 1497, at the
age of thirty-two, a victim to mob-law. The last of these
poems, ‘Nutricia,’ was dedicated, in 1491, several years after
its composition, to the Cardinal of Sant’Anastasia, Antonio
Pallavicino Gentile of Genoa, who had great influence in state
affairs under Innocent VIII. and Alexander VI., and took
much interest in literature and literary men. At the close
of the dedication Poliziano gratefully alludes to the cardinal’s
efforts to further his cause with the Pope.</p>

<p>As we have said, the ‘Sylvæ’ were prolegomena to lectures
on literature. To a cycle of another kind, to lectures
given at Florence in 1483 on the Aristotelian philosophy,
Poliziano composed a prose introduction, probably the
strangest ever heard at any university.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The very title&mdash;‘Lamia’
(the Witch)&mdash;sounds strange, and we almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
suspect a joke, but find that the author is in earnest. The
beginning of this address to his students is highly characteristic.
‘Have you ever heard tell of witches? When I was
a little boy my grandmother used to tell me about the witches
in the neighbouring wood, who eat up naughty children.
Fancy what an image of terror a witch was to me in those
days! In the neighbourhood of my little villa at Fiesole
there is a little brook, hidden by the shadow of the hill-side,
and the women of the place who go there to draw water say
that it is a place of meeting for the witches. But what is a
witch? Plutarch of Chæronea, who was as grave as he was
learned, relates that the witches have artificial eyes which
they can put in and take out at their pleasure, just as weak-sighted
old people do with their spectacles, which they stick
on their noses when they want to look carefully at something
and then put back into the case; or as others do with their
false teeth, which they lay aside with their clothes when
they go to bed;&mdash;not to mention your helpmeets, ye married
men, with their bought braids and curls. If a witch desires
to take a walk she puts in her eyes, and wanders through
streets and alleys, squares and markets, churches and offices,
taverns and baths, looks at everything, thrusts her nose into
everything, meddles with everything, let a man do what he
may. She has the eyes of an owl and a spy, like the old
maid in Plautus. She can find out a grain of sand, and bury
herself in the narrowest cranny. When she gets home, as
soon as she reaches the threshold, she takes out her eyes and
puts them in her pocket. Out of doors she has eyes like a
lynx, at home she is blind. You ask what she does then?
She sits spinning yarn, and humming a little song from time
to time. Have you Florentines never known such witches,
who know nothing of their own business, but are always busy
about other people’s? No? Yet there are many of them in
all cities, even here in yours. But they go about in disguise&mdash;you
take them for men and women, but they are witches.
Once it befell that some of them, happening to see me, stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
still, and looked at me curiously, as those desirous to buy are
wont to do. They whispered to each other, with uncouth
gestures, “That is Poliziano&mdash;that is the rhymester who has
suddenly dressed himself up as a philosopher,” and then they
hurried away like wasps robbed of their sting. What they
meant by their discourse is not clear to me; whether it displeases
them that a man should be a philosopher, which,
however, I am not, or that I venture to play the philosopher
without having the material to do so. Let us now see what
sort of a creature it is that men call a philosopher. You
will soon perceive that I do not belong to the species. I say
this not because I think that you believe it, but that no one
may take it into his head to believe it. Not that I should
be ashamed of the name, if it agreed with the facts, but
because I prefer to keep free from titles which are not due
to me:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Ne si forte suas repetitum venerit olim<br />
Grex avium plumas, moveat cornicula risum.</p>

<p class="p1">This therefore is the first point. The second is, whether the
condition of a philosopher is bad. When I have proved the
contrary I will speak to you briefly of myself and the subject
of my lectures.’ After this introduction follows a sketch of
the course of Grecian philosophy, and an exposition of the
work of the later schools of thought.</p>

<p>The man who raised to such a height the poetry of his
native tongue, and the idiom from which it sprang, was
deeply interested in popular poetry. He went hand in
hand with his patron and friend in efforts to bring back
language and literature ‘from the constraint of false rules to
truth and nature.’ Both found the popular minstrelsy in the
peculiar shape it retains to the present day, and differing
completely in tone from the songs of other lands. In the
<i>rispetti</i> the ottava rima predominates, treated freely as it
was in Boccaccio’s days for epic poetry. Even the sentimental
pieces are epigrammatically pointed, and full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
antitheses, which give an impression of artificiality and
imitation of the antique, more especially in southern
Tuscany and the Roman district. They are not narratives,
nor do they develope a state of mind, but they vividly describe
momentary emotion. Without making up a whole history with
such little songs, like Pulci and Lorenzo de’ Medici, Poliziano
composed a series of <i>rispetti</i> describing joy and sorrow,
accepted and especially despised love. They are partly in
dialogue, frequently in a natural easy style, which reminds
us of improvisations, more tender in expression, more flexible
in diction than the two writers above mentioned, who not
unfrequently betray that they are mocking at their own
work. Other similar songs, but without internal connection,
display a versatility resulting naturally from the way in
which they originated. These fugitive poems grew within
the Medicean circle, products of social intercourse in the
villa and in evening walks in the garden; or, like the dance-songs
(<i>ballate</i>), of which Poliziano wrote a great number,
they were sung with music in the public squares. In short,
they belonged to the life of the people who had furnished
models for the rhymes composed for them by the poets of
quality, with greater refinement, and not always without a
secondary object in view.</p>

<p>Poliziano’s versatility is wonderfully shown in the labours
he undertook in the field of classical philology while thus
wandering through the woods of poetry. He was one of the
first to establish the true principles of textual criticism; at
the request of Innocent VIII. he translated Herodian’s
Roman history into Latin,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and made the writings of
Hippocrates and Galen accessible to those of his countrymen
who were not acquainted with Greek. On the latter
occasion he claimed the assistance of the learned doctor
Pietro Leoni, who was then lecturing in Padua, to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the correct rendering of the medical terms.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The most
talented poet of the fifteenth century was also the philologer
who, while equal to others in knowledge of antiquity, represents
its spirit with more truth and originality. In trying to rival
the classical letter-writers, Poliziano followed a fashion that
had influenced statesmen and men of learning from Petrarca
downwards. He left a mass of epistolary testimony to the
character of his age, the value of which must not be lightly
estimated, though it may not always answer the expectations
raised by the names. Like Ficino and others, Poliziano had
arranged his Latin correspondence for publication, and wrote
a dedication to Piero de’ Medici, when death cut short his
career.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> More interesting to us than the generality of these
letters, which nevertheless contain valuable matter, are his
confidential letters in the vulgar tongue, not meant for publication.
Even this highly gifted man was not free from the
bad habit of the learned men of the fifteenth century&mdash;the
intermixture of Latin phrases with Italian when the subject
gave no occasion for it.</p>

<p class="pch">POLIZIANO IN THE MEDICEAN HOUSE. SCALA AND RUCELLAI.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">For</span> many of his contemporaries Lorenzo de’ Medici was the
frequent subject of verse, especially Latin verse, which the
complimentary art of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
preferred as the more dignified, even after Italian poetry
had secured a position by considerable achievements. Many
of these poetical productions have been rescued from oblivion
only to sink back again, unless they contribute to the historical
knowledge of the period. Their literary worth consists
merely in a talent for form which was surpassed by most of
the Latinists of the following century. Fortunately the
court-poet of the Medici was Poliziano. Many of his epigrams
are addressed to Lorenzo, and the elegance of the
form as well as the warmth of feeling which breathes
through all he wrote about his patron, diminishes that impression
of servility which is inseparable from this kind of
poetry. Praise of his discretion and foresight, of his words
and deeds&mdash;wishes that he may attain the age of Nestor, as
he already possesses his wisdom&mdash;thanks for favour granted,
and offers of future service, are the themes of verse, as well
as the merits of a swift runner, of a Spanish hound, of a tree
before the Medicean house, supposed to be dead, but which
had bloomed again, and of the brook of Ambra. During
Giuliano’s lifetime, the concord between the two brothers
was the object of praise; they were called Castor and Pollux,
Agamemnon and Menelaus. Angelo wrote an agreeable
love-poem of some length on the name of Giuliano. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thoroughly belonged to the Medicean household. He was
still young when Lorenzo entrusted to him the education of
his son Piero; but before the latter was eight years old
dissensions occurred which caused the poet-pedagogue many
an hour of discomfort.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1478, when war and sickness made a
residence in Florence undesirable, Lorenzo, as already stated,
sent his wife and children to Pistoja, where they were hospitably
received in the house of Andrea Panciatichi, the
head of an influential family inclined to the Medici. They
were accompanied by Angelo Poliziano, other masters, and
a doctor. Here Piero, only seven years old, with his great-uncle
Giovanni Tornabuoni received Ercole d’Este, who was
going to take the command at Florence. In October they
exchanged their residence at Pistoja for the villa at Fiesole,
where the family circle was increased by the sons of Niccolò
Orsini, Count of Pitigliano. And here arose a difference
between the mother and the tutor. Clarice was a good and
careful mother. Giovanni, who was not yet three, had soon
after his birth given occasion for anxiety, and been a great
trouble to her and to his grandmother, on account of his
delicate health. Concerning Giuliano, then a few months
old, whose constitution always remained feeble, she wrote
later to her husband: ‘I will care for him as a mother
should, but I beseech you to take care of yourself for the
children’s sake and mine.’ Poliziano’s mode of bringing up
did not satisfy her. Not that she began with a prejudice
against him; the good terms on which they had once been
are proved by the letters which he addressed to her on
several occasions when he was absent from Florence with
Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He bestowed great care on his young pupil, of
whose writing and composition he sent specimens to the
father. ‘I shall not fail,’ he wrote to Lorenzo from Pistoja,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
September 20, ‘in attention and fidelity. I know what I
owe to your Magnificence, and I feel for Piero and your other
children an affection equal to that of a father. Should anything
unpleasant occur, I will endeavour myself to bear it,
out of love to you, to whom I owe everything.’ These words
show that there was already something amiss. Four weeks
previously he had written: ‘I am busy with Piero, and encourage
him to write, and I think in a few days you will
receive a letter which will astonish you. We have a master
here who teaches writing in a fortnight, so that it seems
quite a miracle. The children are particularly happy, and
look quite blooming. Piero never leaves my side. I would
that I could serve you in greater things; but this is my
work, and I fulfil it with joy. But I beg you to ensure,
either by letter or by a messenger, that my authority shall
not be restricted, so that I may the more easily guide the
boy and fulfil my duty. Nevertheless, act therein according
to your pleasure. Whatever may happen, I will bear it with
equanimity.’ And on the same day: ‘We get on as well as
we can, but I cannot escape a few collisions.’ That he was
dissatisfied, dull, and longing to be near Lorenzo, is clear
from all his letters at this time, both to Madonna Lucrezia
and to her son.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, came the <i>villeggiatura</i> at
Caffaggiuolo, whither Clarice went in November. This
was, from position and climate, a melancholy winter residence,
where loneliness and bad weather seem to have put
the excitable man doubly out of humour, and all the more so
because Lorenzo’s old tutor, Gentile Becchi, who lived at the
country house with the family, grew very unsociable in consequence
of the sad circumstances of the time, which weighed
heavily on the mind of this vehement accuser of the Pope.
Gentile had felt the events of the spring deeply, and had
been terribly cast down by the death of Giuliano. Poliziano
had tried to cheer him with an ode, which has acquired historical
importance from the testimony it bears to the hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of foreign aid which were cherished by the adherents of the
Medici and many of the Florentine people; hopes which
were but very partially fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The poem seems to have had little or no effect, and the
poet himself became infected with melancholy. ‘The news
from this place,’ wrote Poliziano to Madonna Lucrezia, on
November 18, ‘is that it rains violently and incessantly, so
that it is impossible to leave the house, and instead of hunting
we have taken to playing ball, that the children may
have exercise. I sit by the fire in dressing-gown and slippers,
and if you saw me you would take me for melancholy incarnate;
for that is what I seem to myself. I do, see, hear
nothing that cheers me, so deeply have our misfortunes
affected me. Sleeping or waking, I have nothing in my
head but these fancies. The day before yesterday we were
all in joyful excitement, because we heard that the sickness
had ceased. Now we are down again, as there is said to
be some still going about. In town we have at least
some comfort, if it is only that of seeing Lorenzo come home
safe and well. Here, everything makes us uneasy, and I
assure you I am dying of melancholy, such a burthen is
loneliness to me. Monsignore (Becchi) shuts himself up in
his own room, with no company but his thoughts; and I find
him so cast down and full of care that his society only increases
my own sadness. Ser Alberto del Malerba (a priest
who was then in the Medicean household) recites the service
all day long with the children. When I am tired of studying,
my fancy goes off on a chase through pestilence and
war&mdash;grief for the past, anxiety for the future. I have no
one to turn my thoughts to him, and am dying of weariness.
And here I have not my Madonna Lucrezia to whom I can
vent my feelings.’</p>

<p>At last matters came to an open breach. On May 6,
1479, Poliziano wrote to Lorenzo from Careggi: ‘I am here
at Careggi, having left Caffaggiuolo by command of Madonna
Clarice. The grounds of my departure, I desire, aye I
earnestly entreat, to be allowed to explain to you by word of
mouth, for it is a prolix affair. I believe that, when you
have heard me, you will find that the wrong is not all on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
side. For decency’s sake, and in order not to go to Florence
without your orders, I came here, and am waiting till your
Magnificence informs me what I am to do. For I am yours,
though the world itself should turn upside down; and if
fortune will not smile upon me in your service, that will not
prevent me from always faithfully devoting myself to that
service. I commend myself to your Magnificence, and am
entirely at your commands.’ What had moved Madonna
Clarice to this strong measure is clear. She could have
nothing to say against the scholar; but the man inspired
her with very little confidence, although we cannot think
that she was influenced by the evil rumours which were
afterwards spread as to Poliziano’s moral conduct&mdash;rumours
characteristic of a time that delighted in the most dishonouring
accusations. Men of letters were so full of exaggerated
self-importance, and so incapable of controlling
their tongues or their pens, that Lorenzo’s wife probably had
right on her side. She wanted to superintend her children’s
education; the tutor would not suffer it. ‘As for Giovanni,’
wrote he to Lorenzo from Caffaggiuolo on April 6, when he enclosed
a letter from Piero, ‘his mother makes him read in the
Psalter, which I cannot at all approve. When she does not interfere
with him his progress is surprising, so that he can read
without any help.’ To give the Psalter to a child of three as
a reading-book is certainly a strange proceeding. But if, as
we must suppose, it was the translation made for Clarice by
Marsilio Ficino, the scholar of the fifteenth century could
not make the same objection which was made in the next
by another scholar, who received the cardinalate&mdash;Pietro
Bembo&mdash;to the reading of St. Paul’s Epistles: that they
spoilt one’s style.</p>

<p>At this time Lorenzo was so much occupied with the
crisis in public affairs that strife in his own household must
have been doubly troublesome to him. He did not think of
restoring to his post the pedagogue who had been turned out
of doors. He offered him the villa at Fiesole, where Poliziano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wrote Latin verses in praise of Lorenzo, about the leisure he
was himself enjoying, of the pleasant view towards the city
of the Muses, and of the winding Arno,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> but evidently put
no bridle on his tongue. ‘I should like,’ wrote Madonna
Clarice to her husband on May 28 from Caffaggiuolo,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> after
affectionately entreating him to take care of his health during
the continued sickness, ‘not to be put into a fable like
Luigi Pulci in Matteo Franco’s verses. I also wish that
Messer Angelo shall not be able to boast of remaining in the
house in defiance of me, or of your having offered him a
home at Fiesole. You know I told you that if it was your
will that he should remain here, I would be content, and
although I have had to submit to his rudeness, I would bear
it patiently if such were your decision, though I cannot
believe it possible.’ Clarice’s remonstrances must have
made some impression on Lorenzo. Although Poliziano
saw him frequently, he remained excluded from the house.
He repeatedly and urgently commended his cause to Madonna
Lucrezia, to whom he represented his difficult position,
if the hopes set on Piero came to nothing.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He begged her
to try to fathom Lorenzo’s intentions concerning him. The
tutor of Giovanni Tornabuoni’s sons, Martino della Comedia,
gave lessons to Piero for a time, as did also Bernardo Michelozzi
(son of the architect), who actually educated Giovanni,
and was afterwards Bishop of Forlì. Poliziano’s impatience
and vexation are clearly shown. ‘I shall be much surprised,’
he wrote, ‘if they let Piero lose his time, and it really would
be a pity. I understand that Messer Bernardo is there, but
I cannot quite see how he is to go on with my work, unless
he remains permanently. In this case, indeed, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
just as well that the shell has burst. But I do not believe it,
and therefore I beg you to find out Lorenzo’s intentions, that
I may judge whether to arm myself for the tourney or the
battle. I will always order myself according to Lorenzo’s
wishes, for I am certain that he sees deeper into things than
I, and that he will guard my honour as he always has done,
and as my faithful services give me some right to expect.’</p>

<p>When the reconciliation took place cannot be discovered
from Poliziano’s letters, which are missing for several years
at this period. The verses addressed to Lorenzo on his return
from Naples, show that at that time Poliziano had not returned
to his house.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> A year after, in 1481, Piero was again
entrusted to his guidance; for the Latin dictation for him,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
in which the siege of Otranto by the Duke of Calabria is
mentioned, is of this year. In these subjects for translation,
which sometimes treat of contemporary events, sometimes
allude to this or that occurrence of daily life, we vainly seek
any really healthy food for a youthful mind. Their want of
connectedness and gravity gives no brilliant testimony to the
highly gifted man’s powers of teaching. But Piero had
other teachers besides Poliziano; among them was the theologian
Giorgio Cenigno, in whose learning and conduct
Lorenzo, who was often present at his lectures, had great
confidence, and to whose judgment he afterwards submitted
the defence of Pico della Mirandola. This is the same man
who many years later took so decided a part with Reuchlin
against those who accused him of heresy. Giovanni del Prato,
afterwards Bishop of Aquila, and Antonio Barberini, a professor
of theology at Florence, were also called in.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When
Piero went to Rome, in 1484 and again in 1488, the first
time to welcome Pope Innocent VIII., the second time to be
married, Poliziano accompanied him, and he remained until
his death a member of the most intimate circle of the family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He never was a priest, though he held a couple of ecclesiastical
benefices.</p>

<p>We can well understand that the choice of a man of such
uncommon intellectual gifts as a tutor, at a time when everything
was expected to give way to classical culture, found
many eulogists; and the words of Cristoforo Landino in
his dedication of Virgil’s works to Piero de’ Medici do not
stand alone. Piero was wanting neither in understanding
nor the desire to learn, and the instruction he received was
not wasted so far as concerns the elegant culture which was
fast superseding the more practical education of older times.
But the essential principle of a serious moral view of the
world Angelo Poliziano could not give to his pupil, for he
had it not himself. The father rejoiced in the progress of
the son, promoted as it was by the liberal, scientific, artistic
and social movement of which the house of Medici formed
the centre. Piero, like his father, entered life early, and was
thus prepared for the position he was in some degree destined
to inherit. He always showed interest in scientific
matters. It was at his desire that his tutor made the collection
of letters above mentioned, which, however, were not
printed till after Poliziano’s death and Piero’s banishment;
a collection which, like many of the kind, contains much
that for the writer’s honour had better have remained unprinted.
But posterity has not confirmed Poliziano’s judgment
on his pupil. It was the judgment of a courtier. In
Piero, thus he wrote to Pico della Mirandola,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> there lived
again the spirit of his father, the virtue of his grandfather,
the humanity of his great-grandfather, the honesty, piety,
generosity, and high-mindedness of all his ancestors.</p>

<p>If Lorenzo could not keep the peace in his own house
between his wife and a literary friend, still less could he keep
it between the latter and another member of his confidential
circle. To this belonged, like Poliziano, a man whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
literary merits contributed nothing to the celebrity of the
age, but who attained to a higher and more secure position
than most of his compeers because he showed himself a
manageable and useful tool. Bartolommeo Scala,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> born
about 1430 at Colle in the valley of the Elsa, has himself
described his origin and the commencement of his fortunes
in a letter to Poliziano, and he deserves at least some credit
for avowing so openly what it is true everybody already knew.
‘Deprived of all worldly goods, poor, and born of parents of
low degree, I came here, without means, without claims,
without protectors, without relations. Cosimo, the father of
the country, took me up, and I rose in the service of his
family.’<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> His father was a miller, and the youth’s first
years in Florence were passed in bitter want, as we know
from the letters of Cardinal Ammanati, who was there in not
very brilliant circumstances. As in the case of other
<i>protégés</i>, Cosimo’s favour was continued by his heirs. This
only will account for the fact that, after the death of Benedetto
Accolti, Scala received the office of chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Although
by no means without cultivation and practice in
business, Scala stood far below those who had preceded him
with so much distinction in the chancellorship, since the
days of Coluccio Salutati to the time of the man whom he replaced.
For Benedetto Accolti, who died in the prime of
manhood, did honour to the name which his family had
already acquired in the field of learning, and united sound
knowledge of law with unusual elegance of expression; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his eloquence and excellent memory rendered him peculiarly
fit for the various solemnities at which addresses and replies
had to be made without long preparation. His Latin history
of the first Crusade, founded on French materials, and
dedicated to Piero de’ Medici, is valuable as the source
whence Torquato Tasso drew the subject of his ‘Gerusalemme.’</p>

<p>Fortune continued to favour Bartolommeo Scala, and
even in the great commotion of 1494 he was not overthrown.
Posts of honour, embassies, knighthood, riches, fell to his
share. He was Lorenzo’s confidant, and in constant correspondence
with him on civil and political affairs. In the
storms of 1478 and the following years he was of no small
use to him, and it was chiefly through him that Lorenzo
always kept the Signoria well in hand. Scala had a pretty
villa&mdash;which afterwards passed to the Guadagni<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>&mdash;on the
slope of the hill at Fiesole, and his town house (now belonging,
with its beautiful gardens, to the Count della Gherardesca)
still bears on its walls the coat of arms which he
adopted in allusion to his name. As two of his predecessors
had written a history of Florence, he thought it needful to do
the same. His work, which comes down to Charles of
Anjou, has no intrinsic value; and his other writings are
even more utterly forgotten than those of the obscurest
among his contemporaries. That he was most anxious to
give no ground of displeasure to foreign princes on whose
relations to Florence he was obliged to touch in his history
is shown by his oft-repeated request to the Ferrarese ambassador
for information about the Este family, ‘because he
wished to write in praise of that illustrious house.’<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Bartolommeo Scala’s position made him boastful. His
letters to Poliziano are full of the most ridiculous conceit.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
‘Thou wilt hardly venture to compete with my honours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The Florentine people have raised me first to the Priorship,
then to the Gonfaloniership, and now to the rank of senator
and knight, with such unanimity that many were of opinion
there had never been a more popular act; besides which I
have the brilliant testimony of Lorenzo de’ Medici that distinction
was never conferred on one more worthy.’ Whereupon
Poliziano did not fail to pay him back with an abusive
answer. His boast of praise from Cosimo and Lorenzo was
a lie; the latter had often said that in advancing him he
was influenced by other considerations, not by his own
opinion, and had often given Poliziano Scala’s official papers
to correct, as the latter must have known very well. Lorenzo
had prevented the former from destroying the mocking
iambics on Scala,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> saying it was a pity to sacrifice such good
verses. Lorenzo de’ Medici was dead when the two became
involved in that violent strife which gave rise to accusations
as passionate, coarse, and spiteful as those flung about by
Filelfo, Poggio, and Valla. But in the lifetime of Lorenzo
a quarrel broke out between the two men, who emulated each
other in abasing the moral dignity of scholarship.</p>

<p>There seems to have been another cause of strife besides
literary rivalry&mdash;Scala’s beautiful and accomplished daughter
Alessandra. Like many other women of her day, she devoted
herself in her youth to the study of Greek, and her
teachers were Demetrius Chalcondylas and Johannes
Lascaris. That Poliziano was inspired with a violent
passion for her is shown by his Greek epigrams.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p class="pp4 p1">‘Now at last have I found the object I long have been seeking,</p>
<p class="pp6">Object of loving desire, present in all my dreams.’</p>

<p class="p1">But Alessandra, though she exchanged Greek verses with
her admirer, and sent him flowers and received small presents,
seems to have been very far from returning his affection.
She tells him plainly that he has not found what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sought; paying him at the same time compliments on his
learning and fame, which do not seem to have consoled him
much. When the disdainful beauty gave her hand to
Michael Marullus Tarcagnota, a Greek established in Italy
early in life, jealousy made Poliziano pour forth a torrent of
abuse, which provoked corresponding replies. Time had
been when verses addressed by Poliziano to Lorenzo, son of
Pier Francesco de’ Medici, the patron of Marullus, overflowed
with praises of the Greek, who was pronounced
superior to Catullus.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Now just as immoderate in the
opposite sense, Angelo’s invectives were most extravagant
against the man who had become his happy rival. Under
the name of Mabilius, he satirised his person and writings,
heaping upon him all the abuse that could be raked out
of the poems of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Personalities of every kind, moral and physical, are flung
backwards and forwards <i>usque ad nauseam</i>. Poliziano’s
hooked nose and crooked neck, and the supposed infidelity
of both combatants are mutually held up to contempt. Well-turned
though the epigrams may be, they were better absent
from the works of a great poet. Alessandra, the innocent
cause of strife, having become a widow, withdrew to the
convent of San Pier Maggiore, and died there in 1506.</p>

<p>Among those who rivalled the professed men of learning
while taking an active part in public affairs, Alamanno
Rinuccini holds a foremost place.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> He was descended from
an old noble family, whose castle near San Donato alla
Collina, on the road which leads from Florence to Arezzo,
along the left bank of the Arno, still keeps much of its
mediæval character. Born in 1419, he was a pupil of Poggio
and Argyropulos; in his translations from the Greek and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
his original Latin writings he displayed a perfect command
of both tongues, and his house was a place where his friends
met for learned discourse. He rose to the highest offices in
the city, and fulfilled with equal zeal the chancellorship of
the Universities of Florence and Pisa, various diplomatic
embassies, and a post in the war department conferred on him
in 1495, three years before his death. Like his father Filippo
and his brother Neri, he left valuable notes on contemporary
events. Although an old partisan of the Medici, he nevertheless,
while fully admitting Lorenzo’s intellectual gifts, passes
on him a severe judgment, showing how the spirit of independence
still survived among the aristocracy, and how hard
it was for the Medici to secure their support, even by raising
them to office. At the same time the virulent attacks on
Lorenzo’s government throw a strange light on the character
of the writer, who never failed to profit by the favours bestowed
on him. It was much the same with Bernardo
Rucellai, one of the most esteemed members of the Medicean
circle. He controlled his ambition during the life of his
brother-in-law Lorenzo; but when that firm hand was gone
and personal considerations no longer restrained him, he
took his own course. He had early distinguished himself in
his classical and philosophical studies, and while scarcely
more than a youth was a professor at the University of Pisa.
Of his Latin historical writings, that on the war of Pisa is
founded on the narratives of Gino and Neri Capponi; that
on the wars of Charles VIII. of France possesses some intrinsic
value as the narrative and judgment of a contemporary
whose high position opened to him trustworthy sources
of information. Both display his command of style; and
his topography of ancient Rome shows how well versed he
was in ancient literature.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The first principle of this work is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a mistake, because it rests on the so-called <i>regionarii</i>, that
arbitrarily interpolated version of the old topographical
texts; but Rucellai surpassed all his predecessors in
thoroughness of learning. At Lorenzo’s death he entered
upon a new phase, not merely in political life. It was he
who, after the storms which burst over Florence in 1494,
received into his new house, with its large and beautiful
gardens in the Via della Scala, the Platonic Academy, then
in danger of sharing the ruin of the Medici. In these
‘Orti Oricellari’ the Academy was kept alive through the
brilliant but unquiet times that followed.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here, where Bernardo
Rucellai brought together some of the sculptures
scattered at the plundering of the Medici palaces, Niccolò
Machiavelli read his book on the art of war; here in 1516
Leo X. was present at a representation of the tragedy of
‘Rosmonda,’ written by Bernardo’s son Giovanni; and here
in 1522 was laid the plot against Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici
which put an end to the Academy for ever.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">ERMOLAO BARBARO AND PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> Florentines and other Tuscans gathered together at
this period of manifold intellectual activity were joined by
men from other parts of Italy, coming as transient visitors
or permanent residents. Three of these deserve especial
consideration&mdash;Bernardo Bembo, Ermolao Barbaro, and Pico
della Mirandola. We have already seen Bembo as Venetian
ambassador, in the difficult state of affairs which followed on
the conspiracy of the Pazzi. He had received this honourable
appointment several years before, and held it until peace
was restored. The relations between Venice and Florence
were not always pleasant and confidential; but the Venetian
ambassador knew how to make himself agreeable and to
inspire confidence. Poliziano praised his activity and caution
in affairs of state, his amiability in personal intercourse, his
interest in literature, his union of seriousness and gaiety.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Ficino and Landino were on friendly terms with him, as
their correspondence and literary communications prove.
Bembo was one of the members of the Platonic Academy,
and a banquet given to him by his colleagues in 1480 is described
by Marsilio in his book on Platonic theology. He
was an ardent lover of books, and wrote a beautiful hand;
the octavo form of the Aldine editions, the first variation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
from the old folio or large quarto usual until then, is said to
have been an imitation of one of his manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Bernardo’s
son was with him during his residence on the banks
of the Arno, and the pure dialect to which the boy’s ear
became accustomed falling on good ground, led to that
scientific treatment of the Italian tongue which has given
Pietro Bembo a claim to be considered a distinguished master
of the language he handled with so much power and facility
of expression.</p>

<p>One of those who were in constant literary intercourse
with Lorenzo, and assisted him in collecting manuscripts, &amp;c.,
was Ermolao Barbaro the younger. Literary faculty was
the heritage of his family. His grandfather, Francesco Barbaro,
held friendly intercourse with the scholars of Rome
and Florence and with Cosimo de’ Medici. He also made
at Venice the largest collection of books of that time, and
devoted himself zealously to studying the texts, as is proved
by his copy of Homer preserved in the library of St. Mark.
Young Ermolao was brought up by the care of a learned
uncle of the same name, who was Bishop of Treviso and for
many years administered the bishopric of Verona.</p>

<p>Francesco owed some of his accomplishments to Matteo
Bosso, whom we shall meet again in the abbey at Fiesole;
and at Rome a classical turn had been given to his studies
by Pomponio Leto. He was a young man when the Republic,
which looked quite as much to the learned accomplishments as
to the political capacity and noble birth of her envoys, sent
him to the Emperor Frederic, to Lodovico il Moro, and to Innocent
VIII. The last embassy was not propitious to him.</p>

<p>When in 1491 he accepted the Patriarchate of Aquileia
from the Pope without asking the consent of the Republic,
this offence against law and precedent was punished by the
senate with deprivation and banishment, and Barbaro died
near Rome, of an infectious disease, in the summer of 1493,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
at the early age of thirty-three.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Of his many works, chiefly
on Greek writers, none seem now to justify his reputation.
His studies on Pliny’s ‘Natural History’ hold an honourable
place among the critical investigations begun in his day, and
his lively wit shines forth in his letters.</p>

<p>Ermolao came through Florence on his way to Rome in
the spring of 1490. As Lorenzo de’ Medici was then at the
baths of Vignone, his eldest son received the stranger with
the honour due to his rank and the friendly relations between
the families. Piero’s letter to his father has some
literary as well as personal interest:<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> ‘Illustrious father,&mdash;By
a letter from you which reached Ser Piero yesterday morning
I was informed of your desires with respect to Messer
Ermolao, who arrived yesterday after dinner. His arrival
was, so to say, unexpected, and I only heard of it about an
hour before. I went to meet him, as did four or five others,
and he had to go first to the hotel, as his quarters were not
yet ready, whither he afterwards came on foot. As soon as
he had arrived, I went to him, according to your desire, to
invite him to us, and to inquire how long he intended to
stay. I invited him for to-day, and heard that it was his
intention to remain only the one day, as he wants to travel
to-morrow as far as Poggibonzi or some other place, so that
he may reach Siena before noon on the following day.
Whether he means to stay there I do not know. To-day he
has been our guest, and I cannot say how much pleasure
this has given him. Besides his suite, which consists of his
brother (Luigi), a secretary of St. Mark, and a doctor, we
invited the persons whom he wished to see; they were the
Count della Mirandola, Messer Marsilio, and Messer Agnolo
of Montepulciano, to whom, as we wished to have an inhabitant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the city and yet to keep within the circle of intimate
friends and scholars, we added Bernardo Rucellai. Whether
we did right I know not. After dinner I showed him the
house, the coins, vases, sculptured stones&mdash;in short everything,
including the garden (near San Marco), which he
especially liked, though he does not seem to understand
much about sculpture. The value and age of the coins interested
him greatly; they were all astonished at the quantity
of fine things. I cannot tell you much about him,
except that he speaks very elegantly, as far as I can judge,
and that he likes to show his reading by quoting the ancients,
sometimes in Latin. His appearance is on the whole very
good; he is temperate in all things, which is probably needful
for him, as he seems to have a very delicate constitution.
He is said to be an adroit man of business, which I rather
doubt, as he seems to me somewhat ceremonious. He could
not display greater friendship for you than he does, and I
believe he means it. He received all the honour done him
with much gratitude, not at all after the Venetian fashion;
and indeed nothing but his dress shows him to be a Venetian.
According to his own account, he has a great desire to see
you, and he says he will willingly go out of his way to meet
and salute you; which I think it my duty to mention, in
case it should meet your views. He also says that he is
commissioned by his Signoria to salute you. He has been
honourably treated by the citizens, and received compensation
for having to alight at the hotel. This morning, before
he came to dinner, he presented himself to the Signoria,
with complimentary greetings.’ That the learned Venetian
fulfilled his intention of saluting Lorenzo on his way, we
learn from Lorenzo himself, who wrote to his agent at Siena
on May 15 as follows: ‘Ermolao was here early this morning,
and continued his journey after staying a while with
me.’<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>When Ermolao Barbaro fell into disgrace with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
government, Lorenzo took his part warmly. Among other
things he tried to persuade the Pope to give him the red
hat, probably hoping that such a distinction would reconcile
the Signoria to him. Ermolao’s father gratefully acknowledged
his friend’s efforts. ‘This morning,’ wrote Poliziano
to Lorenzo from Venice,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> ‘I visited Messer Zaccheria Barbaro,
and when I spoke of your favour he answered weeping,
and as it seemed with a full heart. The sum of his discourse
was this: he has no hope save in you. He made it clear to
me that he is aware how much he owes you. Therefore
carry out what you have planned, and keep a higher object
in view.’ Greek clay vases, given to Poliziano for Lorenzo,
were to prove the gratitude of the Procurator of St. Mark
and the ex-ambassador. But the Signoria evidently did not
approve of a stranger intermeddling in the affairs of one of
their citizens; for when Luigi Barbaro received from his
brother’s successor orders to return from Rome, he was told
at the same time not to come through Florence.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>All plans and calculations were overthrown the following
year by the death of Lorenzo and of the Pope, soon followed
by that of Ermolao himself. That the offer of the cardinalate
would hardly have altered the views of the senate as to the
duty of an ambassador to receive nothing from a foreign
sovereign without special permission, is shown by a parallel
case which occurred in the next century, that of Marc’Antonio
da Mula (Cardinal Amulio).</p>

<p>In the circle of Florentine scholars there was no brighter
star than Giovanni Pico della Mirandola; and yet not one
of them has left so little to justify the contemporary fame of
this ‘Phœnix of spirits.’ Yet he was something more than
a specimen of the sciolism and abstruse pedantry that sought
to dazzle contemporaries without leaving anything solid or
useful to posterity. Giovanni Pico fought manfully against
the errors of his time, and promoted investigations on many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
subjects; but the results of his labours are not discoverable in
the picture of the time as a whole, to which he contributed but
a few traits, instead of producing a work of durable value
that would have vividly represented the progress of science.
Born and brought up in the highest circles of society, it is
remarkable that with his quick and passionate temperament
he devoted himself to scientific work, ardently and perseveringly,
without any external inducement to do so. He
comes forth like a meteor, in brilliant but momentary splendour.
He was a younger son of Gian Francesco Pico, Lord
of Mirandola and Count of Concordia, and Giulia Bojardo,
daughter of Feltrino Count Of Scandiano, whose grandson
Matteo Maria made himself famous as the author of ‘Orlando
Innamorato.’ In his childhood Giovanni showed
unusual quickness of perception and desire to learn, which
was observed and encouraged by his mother. At fourteen
he went to study canon law at the University of Bologna,
after which he pursued philosophy and theology, languages
and literature, at various universities, and soon displayed a
talent for disputation. He was intended for holy orders, and
while still almost a boy was seen, like Giovanni de’ Medici,
in the dress of an Apostolic protonotary. He was not much
over twenty when he came to Florence at the beginning of
1484. Recommended by his birth and connections, as well
as by Ercole d’Este, whose sister Bianca was his sister-in-law,
he became intimate with the Medici, and lived like a great
man; at the same time he pursued his studies diligently,
and formed friendships with Ficino, Landino, and Poliziano.
The last has described him graphically and with a fair
amount of truth. ‘Nature,’ he says, ‘appeared to have
showered upon this man, or rather this hero, all gifts of
body and mind. He was slender and well made, and something
divine seemed to shine in his face. He was acute in
perception, gifted with an excellent memory, indefatigable
in study, clear and eloquent in expression. One doubted
whether he shone most by his talents or his moral qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Versed in every branch of philosophy, favoured by his perfect
knowledge of several languages, he showed himself
sublime and above all praise.’</p>

<p>What distinguished the young scholar from all the other
members of the Florentine circle except Marsilio Ficino&mdash;though
it did not attract much attention till it brought him
into difficulties with Rome&mdash;was his study of mediæval
Jewish literature, to which he must have found special incitement
at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> For it was here that he began to
study those Jewish mysteries which in Alexandria were first
mixed up with the doctrines of the Bible, like Neoplatonism
with the wisdom of the Athenians, and were developed under
the name of Cabbalah into a lasting tradition of revelation.
Following in the steps of Ficino, Giovanni Pico found the
teachings of Christianity confirmed by those of Platonism;
while the Jewish doctrines furnished him with stronger
proofs, for what Ficino did not demonstrate from Platonism,
Pico drew from the Jewish mysteries. He was quite right
in recognising analogies not to be found in the Greek doctrines;
but it is evident that he stood on ground where
investigation and the play of fancy might bring him into
danger; more especially as he included magic within the
circle of his researches. It was nothing more than the
natural magic which consists mainly in the contemplation of
the powers of the heavenly bodies, but he stated in plain
words his opinion that no science could afford us a clearer
view of the divinity of Christ than magic and the Cabbalah.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived what a sensation was made
in Florence by a distinguished young man of such appearance,
talents, and tendencies. His arrival occurred at a
lucky moment. The end of the Ferrara war left a clear field
for other than political affairs, and the reputation of Lorenzo
de’ Medici had just then reached its zenith. The presence
of Giovanni Pico gave a new distinction to his whole circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
He was one by himself. Ficino and Poliziano had shone by
the early maturity of their talents, but to them study was
the necessary object of their lives; while this youth of high
rank, on whom everything smiled, rivalled them in perseverance
and success and surpassed them in universality of
knowledge. Soon after his arrival at Florence, in a letter
to Lorenzo, he spoke highly of the poems which the latter
wrote on Dante and Petrarca; but this does not prove that
his judgment was sound, and it may, perhaps, not have
greatly impressed Lorenzo himself, though it doubtless did
him no harm in the Medicean circle. In 1485 he went to
continue his studies at Paris, returning thence at the beginning
of the next year. This year he was involved in two
troublesome affairs, one of which&mdash;though injurious to his
reputation&mdash;was only of a passing nature, but the other cast
a shadow over the whole of his after-life, and put an end to
the gaiety of his youth.</p>

<p>The eloquent disciple of the Platonic Academy suddenly
found himself involved in a love adventure that was only too
real. ‘Count Giovanni della Mirandola,’ wrote the Ferrarese
envoy Aldovrandino Guidoni on May 12, 1486, to Duke
Ercole,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> ‘has been living for nearly two years in such
splendour and in the enjoyment of such universal esteem as
has hardly fallen to the lot of any one before in this city.
A few days ago he gave out that he was going to Rome, and
sent forward all his luggage. On his arrival at Arezzo,
where resided a lady with whom he had a love affair&mdash;the
beautiful wife of one Giuliano de’ Medici, engaged in the
administration of taxes there&mdash;the said lady, according to
previous agreement, left her husband’s house. She pretended
to be going for a walk, but just outside the town she
mounted behind the count. He had about twenty people
with him, some on horseback, some on foot, besides two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mounted bowmen. When the people saw the lady surrounded
by this train there was an uproar. The storm-bell was rung
and the count was followed in pursuit, which became so hot
that the count was obliged to give up his fugitive. Every
one of his suite that could be reached was killed and stripped
in the <i>mêlée</i>, and many of the citizens also were left dead.
Thanks to their good horses, the count and his chancellor
got away to Marciano (in the valley of the Chiana), where
they were arrested. The Ten, before whom the case was
laid, at first gave orders to liberate the count and keep the
chancellor, but afterwards they commanded both to be kept
under arrest. Probably nothing will be done to him, but
the chancellor&mdash;on whom the chief blame is laid&mdash;may come
off badly, the more so as the matter concerns the wife of a
Medici, who, though poor, is still one of the family. In
truth, the count’s mishap is much to be regretted, for he
used to be considered a saint as well as a man of learning,
and now he has lost greatly in public opinion, though,
indeed, love has brought many into like errors.’ Duke
Ercole’s mediation was needless, as Pico was at once set
free, and the good easy husband received back into his house
the faithless wife, who pleaded forcible abduction. She was
a rich young widow of low degree when he married her
shortly before. Pico’s own remarks on the whole affair
display his penitence. ‘His sin grieves him,’ he said of
himself, ‘and he does not defend his conduct. He seems to
deserve forgiveness just because he attempts no excuse.
Nothing is weaker than man, nothing is mightier than
love!’</p>

<p>The Roman affair was not so easily disposed of. After
the adventure at Arezzo, Pico went to Rome, where, to
establish the favourite Florentine thesis of an agreement
between Platonism and Christianity, and the assistance to
be derived from the former in combating heresy, he announced
a public disputation on 900 questions, to which,
besides philosophy and theology, law and natural science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
magic and the Cabbalah, Arabia and Chaldæa, had contributed
their quota. Thus the most brilliant intellects,
sometimes even more than others, pay tribute to pedantry.
The fruitful seed that lay buried in these investigations was
in a great measure choked up with the dull rubbish from
which the age was unable to free itself. Many of the affirmations
of the young scholar (which might well seem questionable
at that time) were impeached as contrary to the faith,
and the disputation was stopped. On August 5, 1486,
Innocent VIII. signed a brief against the theses put forth
by Giovanni Pico, denouncing their author in no sparing
terms. The long interval between the signature and the
publication, which did not take place till December 15,
instead of helping to smooth the difficulty, only increased it.
The author of the controverted propositions&mdash;so his opponents
maintained&mdash;being secretly informed of the papal
decision, hastily wrote an apology for them, had it secretly
printed in Naples, and pre-dated it, so that he should not
appear to be defending assertions already condemned by the
highest ecclesiastical authority. The accused denied this,
and declared that he had only received the brief on January
6, 1487, on his journey to France. In any case, his written
defence furnished his opponents with a pretext by which to
set the Pope against him and cause him to receive a citation
to Rome. It was even determined to arrest him, as we see
from a letter addressed to the Pope from Siena, December 5,
by the Bishop of Lucca, excusing the non-fulfilment of the
papal orders on account of his absence from his see.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The ‘Apology,’ dated May 31, 1486, is dedicated to
Lorenzo de’ Medici. ‘God is my witness,’ says the author
in the introduction, ‘that I dedicate this writing to thee,
O Lorenzo, not as thinking it worthy of such a man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
because I have long known that I owe all I possess to thee.
Whatever I am or may become is thine and will remain
thine. I say less than I would, and my words are too cold
to express the love and reverence which I have long felt and
shall continue to feel for thee. To these feelings I am moved
by the numerous proofs of favour that have proceeded rather
from thy mind towards me than from thy position, and
which are as rare as they are characteristic of thee. Receive
this apology with kindness; the gift is small, but it is a
testimony of my lasting devotion. If thou shouldst turn to
it from the important affairs which claim thy attention,
remember that it is a sketch rather than a work carefully
thought out, a task imposed on me by others rather than
chosen by myself, and that I present it to thee, not as a
proof of talents and learning to which I am a stranger, but
as a token, I repeat, of my entire devotion.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo, Ercole d’Este, and Pico’s relatives, took an
active interest in his troubles. All through 1487, while the
accused was abroad, the affair dragged on without result.
The chief hope was in Lorenzo, whose influence with the
Pope was known to be great and increasing, and it was not
his fault that matters did not get on. He did not wait for
the entreaties of Pico’s brother Antonio, who came to
Florence in February 1488 to beg for his interposition at
Rome. He had already, on January 19, written to the
ambassador Lanfredini, giving a warning against extreme
steps, since excommunication or the like against a man so
young and so learned might drive the most moderate beyond
all patience. The solution he suggested was that Pico
should be allowed to go free to Rome and justify himself to
the Pope in person. The envoy did not quite agree with
Lorenzo’s view, being of opinion that the count would do
better to leave theology alone; nevertheless he bestirred
himself zealously on his behalf. ‘To my great satisfaction
and joy,’ writes Lorenzo to him on March 22, 1488,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> ‘I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
been informed of the agreement made by you with the Holy
Father concerning the count. In pursuance of your intimation,
I shall invite the count here. I feel assured he will
conduct himself so that his Holiness shall be satisfied with
him, for which object no efforts shall be wanting on my
part.’ So Giovanni Pico returned to Florence and Lorenzo
continued his intercession. But there were still grave difficulties
in the way of an adjustment, and the accused was
very shy of appearing at Rome. He lived sometimes in
Florence, sometimes at the neighbouring villa of Querceto
and the abbey of Fiesole, where he pursued Hebrew and
Chaldee studies with great ardour, and worked out a commentary
on Genesis. In June 1489, Florence conferred the
freedom of the city on her illustrious guest, and gave him
the right of acquiring property to the value of 6,000 gold
florins. It is evident that Lorenzo was anxious to bind him
more and more closely to himself and his home. ‘The
Count of Mirandola,’ he wrote on June 19 to Lanfredini,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
‘is staying permanently with us, and lives as retired as a
monk, continually working at theology, and commenting on
the Psalms, &amp;c. He reads the service as is usual for priests,
strictly observes the fasts, and has the most simple household
that necessity permits. He appears to me a pattern
for others. But he desires to be cleared before the Holy
Father from the charges brought against him, and to receive
a brief by which he shall be re-admitted as a true son and a
good Christian. I have this much at heart too, for there are
few men dearer to me or that I esteem more highly. To
my mind he is a true Christian, for he conducts himself so
that the whole city would be ready to stand surety for him.
Endeavour to obtain this brief in due form, that his conscience
may be set at rest. This will stand in the first rank
among the many pleasures you have procured me.’</p>

<p>The affair, however, made no progress. The intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
at Rome seemed to be to commission the Bishop of Vaison
to receive the explanations of Pico, who declared himself
ready to submit simply and entirely to the papal decision.
About this time the publication of his commentary on
Genesis gave fresh scandal. A feeling hostile to him seemed
to be gaining ground. On August 17, Lanfredini wrote that
Lorenzo had better advise the count simply to beg for absolution
and perform the needful penance. On October 6 he
declared that it was only out of consideration for Lorenzo
that the Pope was so lenient to the culprit; to satisfy
Lorenzo by giving the cardinalate to his son was quite
another thing&mdash;so his Holiness had said&mdash;from lending an
ear to his intercessions in a case where the faith was at
stake. Finally Lorenzo lost patience when he found that
the Pope was in the hands of his friend’s opponents. ‘I am
greatly displeased,’ he wrote in October 1489, ‘at hearing of
the censures on Mirandola’s work. If I were not convinced
that this persecution arises from envy and malice, I would
not speak of it. Various learned and God-fearing theologians
here have read the book, and all approve it as
excellent and Christian. I myself am not such a bad
Christian that I would keep silence and accept the book if I
thought otherwise. If he only said the Credo, these malicious
spirits would smell heresy in it. If the pressure of
business did but permit his Holiness to take personal cognizance
of the matter and discover the truth, I am certain the
whole thing would fall to pieces and the truth would come
to light. But the Pope has to depend on others, and this
poor man cannot defend himself. If he gives his reasons, he
is said to be speaking against the Holy Father! If he had
only to deal with his enemies unprotected by the papal
authority he would soon put them to silence. His misfortune
is that he has to deal with malicious ignorant foes
who shield themselves behind the head of the Church. I
have already hinted to you my suspicion that they are trying
to drive him to despair, and thereby to some rash step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which might really be directed against his Holiness. For
believe me, Giovanni, this man has it in his power to work
both good and evil. His life and conduct prove the first;
if he is forced to turn another way, I personally shall lose
little thereby, for whatever direction he may take, he will be
attached to me as I to him. I have never succeeded in
quite making you understand this. Without going into
particulars now, I will merely observe that an attempt has
been made to persuade him into a step which might have
given great offence; but I have always prevented it, so that
he is come here, where he is leading a virtuous life and is
in peace. These devils tempt him with their persecutions,
and they are only too readily believed.’</p>

<p>This letter shows how deeply the writer was moved. His
earnest remonstrances succeeded at least so far that Pico,
who, like Galileo afterwards, had been relegated to a villa in
the neighbourhood of Florence, was left unmolested in the
city. At this time occurred the visit of Reuchlin, who came
to Italy for the second time in 1490 in the suite of a son of
Duke Eberhard, and now became personally acquainted with
the man who had given the most decisive impulse to his
studies, which, like the Italian’s, aimed at harmonising the
results of Jewish and Greek wisdom with Christian faith and
knowledge. These studies entered in Germany upon a
new sphere of influence stretching far beyond the scope of
Pico, but not more free from danger, and involving the
German in conflicts similar to those of the Italian. Pico’s
Roman troubles were augmented by others. The dispute
between his brothers Galeotto and Antonio put him into
pecuniary straits, and obliged him to seek the aid of the
Duke of Ferrara.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Obstructions at Rome were endless.
Neither Lorenzo de’ Medici nor Innocent VIII. lived to see
the conclusion, which was brought about at last by a brief
of Alexander VI., June 18, 1493, in which Giovanni Pico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was fully acquitted. The trouble and anxiety caused by this
affair made the deepest impression on his mind. His nephew
and biographer relates that he heard from his own mouth
how great a change it produced in his mind and life.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Excepting
a visit to Ferrara, where at the duke’s desire he was
present at a chapter of the Dominican order, he quitted
Florence no more. We have seen him in the country, in
frequent intercourse with Ficino and Poliziano. He lived
entirely for science; and the wealth which enabled him to
collect a treasury of books was also freely bestowed on the
needy; in these good works he was assisted by his attached
friend Benivieni. He burned his Latin poems, which he had
collected in five books and given to Poliziano for correction.
The latter had altered a few things, as he said, after the
example of him who found fault with the sandals of the
goddess of beauty because he could find none with herself;
and because a few verses seemed to him to be only of the
rank of a knight, while the rest were patrician and senatorial.
Poliziano lamented his friend’s resolve in a letter accompanied
by a Greek epigram. He could not remember,
he said, ever to have read anything more charming, elegant
and polished. ‘Ye silly gods of love,’ thus ends the epigram,
‘why did ye fly to Pico, who is the leader of the Muses?’
Poliziano approved of his friend’s poetical attempts, and admired
his commentary on Benivieni’s <i>canzone</i> on Platonic
love, which the school of Florentine literature reckons among
its most important works, more than his deeper studies,
when in the rustic solitude of Querceto he wrote an extensive
treatise against astrology, destined to form part
of a great polemical work on sects hostile to Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Poliziano thought it was lost time:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">‘Pico, what hast thou to do with this? Thou’rt wasting thy powers:<br />
Truly thy style is too good for this generation of jugglers.’</p>

<p class="p1">Savonarola, on the contrary, who was a friend of the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in his later years, and read the unfinished work, expressed
mingled pleasure and regret over it; pleasure in the stand
made by the work against widespread errors, regret at the
premature death of the gifted author. We must not judge
Pico della Mirandola by what he has left behind. He paid
a heavier tribute to the weaknesses of the time than many
others who were not equal to him in intellectual capacity.
His whole personality must be considered; it is a typical
one. This scion of a princely house, who quitted the world
at two-and-thirty, who had measured the heights and depths
of the learning of his time, who, with all his abstruse scholarship,
preserved a simplicity and amiability of character that
drew all hearts to him, is by far the most brilliant figure in
that brilliant circle. After four centuries Pico della Mirandola
remains the highest representative of early maturity of
intellect. But he is something more; in conjunction with
the man whose friendship was so warmly expressed, he did
more than any other to give a value and importance to a
period which, with all its defects, was beneficent and noble.</p>

<p>The sad fate of two other members of the Florentine literary
circle who were not Tuscans, as well as the circumstance
that both filled public offices in Florence, justifies us in mentioning
them together, though several decades separated them.
They are Stefano Porcaro and Pandolfo Collenuccio. The
former, a Roman knight, was the friend and correspondent
of Poggio, Filelfo, Ciriaco, and Traversari, holding a position
of influence at home and abroad.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> He was led into the fatal
conspiracy of 1453 against Nicolas V. rather by memories of
antiquity and of Cola Rienzi than by his Florentine connections.
In the Podestà’s palace may be seen, in what was
formerly the chapel, a picture of the Madonna painted on
the wall, presented, in 1490, by Pandolfo Collenuccio of
Pesaro, then judge of the supreme court. Ficino, Pico,
Poliziano, admired the intellectual gifts and varied talents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
this learned man. It was wonderful, wrote the latter, what
he was capable of; he managed the affairs of princes with
great sagacity, was surpassed by none in the elegance of his
prose and verse, and decided intricate suits with a rare knowledge
of law. He commanded the most varied knowledge with
such mastery that he made further discoveries when others
fancied they had found out everything. This sound judge
of classical literature was also a student of natural history,
and one of the first to apply the science of history to the
vulgar tongue. He made use of his connection with
Germany, where he had been as envoy from Duke Ercole
d’Este to King Maximilian, to make large acquisitions for
the Florentine libraries. His execution in 1504, by command
of Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro, on pretext of high
treason in the Borgia disturbances, was one of those
tragedies of which there was never any lack in the petty
courts of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="pch">THE UNIVERSITY OF PISA. MANUSCRIPTS AND CRITICISM.
PRINTING. PLATONIC SYMPOSIA.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> circle of Florentine celebrities which, though its members
were continually changing, always retained its peculiar
character, included men of smaller importance than many
of those already described, but yet worthy of mention.
Among these are the philologer-poets who, in endeavouring
to follow Poliziano, lost their individuality in imitations of
the Roman poets of the Flavian and following periods.
Their verses have but an historical and local interest for
posterity, and even the sixteenth century, so busy with
Latin verse-making, passed judgment upon them very
freely.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Ugolino Vieri, who Latinised his name into Verino,
celebrated his native city and its famous men in three
books of a poem, ‘De Illustratione urbis Florentiæ,’ which
spite of a few happy characteristics, is barely more than a dry
catalogue. Naldo Naldi has acquired a more lasting reputation
by his biographical works than by his numerous verses.
People sang each other’s praises without end; and such
laudations, though endurable from a Poliziano, are tiresome
from inferior hands. Alessandro Bracci, one of the secretaries
of state; Giovan Battista Cantalicio, afterwards Bishop
of Penne and Adria; Tommaso Baldinotti of Pistoja; Alessandro
Cortesi, the talented scion of a family of San Gemignano
very intimate with the Medici; Piero Riccio, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
under the Latinised name of Crinitus, and author of a
history of the old Latin poets; these and many other
pupils of Ficino, Landino, and Poliziano, belong to the <i>dii
minorum gentium</i>. Verses by some of them have been
printed, while heaps lie in manuscript in the Laurentian
library to testify to the intellectual activity of the time.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The verses of the Roman Carlo de’ Massimi in praise of
Pisa University have some interest for the history of literature.
Literary productions of every kind were sent to
Lorenzo from all quarters; he was the great patron of
authors. Much of what he received he sent on to San
Marco and to the Abbey of Fiesole, as may be seen by the
inscriptions in the volumes.</p>

<p>All these men, small and great, found in Lorenzo their
Mæcenas. But he showed very early that he invested the
position of patron with more serious importance than his
predecessors had done. When scarcely three-and-twenty
he brought about the restoration of the University of Pisa,
which was not only an act of justice, but, apart from its
literary importance, a token of ripe political insight that
helped to counterbalance in some degree the miseries inflicted
on Volterra in the same year (1472). The university,
formed in the fourth decade of the fourteenth century out
of the existing public schools, and confirmed in 1343 by
Clement VI., fell into decay from political causes later in
the century, and finally succumbed to Florentine enmity.
The mutual animosity of the two cities is only to be paralleled
in the history of antiquity. Twenty-five years after the
subjection of Pisa, the Ministry of War at Florence wrote to
Averardo de’ Medici, their commissioner in the subject
town:<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> ‘According to general opinion here, the most effectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
means of securing the town is to empty it entirely of
Pisan citizens and peasants, concerning which we have
written to the Captain of the People till we are tired. He
answers that he is hindered by the soldiery and officers.
We now command thee to go to him and persuade him to
spare no harshness or severity, as we perceive that no other
remedy will avail. We have confidence in thee that thou
wilt at once set everything to work, for thou couldst do
nothing more pleasing to this whole people.’ The efficacious
result was that the city was ruined, the marshy neighbourhood
left fallow to become the home of fever, and the fleet
vanished. So rooted was this hatred that when Pisa had
freed herself amid the confusion which followed on Lorenzo’s
death, Bernardo del Nero&mdash;a usually moderate man of the
Medicean party&mdash;declared that against the Pisans nothing
availed save force; all prisoners of war must be slain after
the example of the Genoese, who let the Pisan captives
taken at Meloria languish to death in prison.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo early perceived that the blind enmity which
ruined Pisa was overshooting the mark. As his family held
considerable property in the district he frequently had occasion
to visit the city, whose position made it a halting-place
for many travellers between northern and southern Italy.
Pisa must not be allowed to give the Florentines any more
trouble, but neither should it be allowed to perish. Two
considerations in particular seem to have prompted the re-establishment
of the old university. The first was the quiet,
which was more favourable to study than the busy life of
Florence; the second was the number and cheapness of
dwellings, which were in increasing danger of falling to ruin
since trade had departed from its old abodes, and the inhabitants
were nearly all poor people. Yet Lorenzo needed
great power and moral courage to set himself against rooted
hatred and stubborn prejudices. On December 19, 1472,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was issued the decree by which the university was restored
to life.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> A board of management was appointed&mdash;the Officiales
studii&mdash;consisting of five Florentine citizens: Tommaso
Ridolfi, Donato Acciaiuolo, Andrea Puccini, Alamanno
Rinuccini, and Lorenzo de’ Medici. The yearly endowment
was to consist of 6,000 gold florins, and the statutes of the
University of Florence were to be in force at that of Pisa.
Members of the state were to be entitled to academical
honours and the authority to practise in Pisa alone. To
raise the salaries of the professors, Pope Sixtus IV. consented
to a tax on the clergy to the amount of 5,000 florins in five
years, a tax which was renewed by his successor in 1497
for another five years, and drew complaints from Ficino,
Poliziano, and others. Only the philosophical and literary
branches of study were to continue at Florence.</p>

<p>The credit of all this was justly given to Lorenzo. ‘I
heard a few days ago,’ wrote Antonio de’ Pazzi to him from
Padua, January 29, 1473,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> ‘that by your direction a new
university is to be founded at Pisa; at which not only we
Florentine students, but foreign ones too, are greatly delighted,
seeing that Pisa is a city eminently suited for it,
and because the scheme proceeds from a man who will strive
to acquire honour by this as by all else that he undertakes.’
Scholars came flocking from all parts, and first among them
Francesco Filelfo. He had found an asylum with the Sforza
at Milan; but, dissatisfied and restless, extravagant and in
debt, he tried to change his position. During the pontificate
of Pius II. he made several attempts to this end, but, failing
in his hopes, he attacked the pontiff before and after death
with his usual invectives, and in consequence was imprisoned
for a time. In April 1473 he applied to Lorenzo. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
time before he had managed to flatter Lorenzo’s father into
forgetting his offences against Cosimo so far as to hold one
of his sons over the font; and when in Florence in the
autumn of 1469, shortly before Piero’s death, he obtained a
loan from Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The letter which he now addressed to
the latter<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> is curiously characteristic of the man. He
attacks those who had long been in their graves&mdash;Marsuppini,
Poggio, and their ‘synagogue.’ He begins by declaring
that the Milanese chancellor, Cecco Simonetta, had
advised him to prefer Pisa to Rome, where he was much
wanted; and he ends with the artless assurance that
Lorenzo must know well he cannot find in all the world a
second Filelfo nor one more devoted to him. In another
letter he remarks in the same style: ‘You are aware that
at the present time no one can stand a comparison with me
in my own branch.’ Simonetta, from Pavia, seconded the
appeal, and sang the vain man’s praises. Lorenzo answered
by asking what salary would be required, but the negotiation
fell through, which Medici probably did not much regret,
as he must have felt some hesitation in attaching the quarrelsome
old man to his young establishment. Besides, the
sentence of banishment once passed on Filelfo was still in
force, and his services in the way of literary invective after
the conspiracy of the Pazzi had not yet smoothed the way to
his return. When he was at last summoned to Florence as
professor of eloquence and moral philosophy, he had scarcely
time to greet the city he had left for nearly half a century
before he died, a few days after his arrival, in the summer
of 1481, in his eighty-third year.</p>

<p>The new-born university, which was opened in November
1473, soon took its share in the working of many active
forces in diverse directions. In its very earliest years it
would have risen to the highly flourishing condition it afterwards
attained had not various unfavourable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
come in the way. The unhealthy air of the city and neighbourhood
had not been sufficiently taken into consideration.
War, desolation, poverty, made matters worse, just at the
time when Florence was also a prey to disease. For six
years the establishment kept moving from place to place.
Professors and students wandered away to Pistoja and Prato,
and sometimes to Florence&mdash;even Empoli and San Miniato
were thought of&mdash;till the state of affairs was improved, and
the hitherto scattered lecturers were brought together in a
university building erected by the care of Lorenzo. There
was no lack of difficulties with the professors; the Sienese
Bartolommeo Sozzini and the Milanese brothers Decio, all
professors of law, gave Lorenzo a great deal of trouble by
their unruly conduct. Among the best professors at the
outset were the jurists Baldo Bartolini of Perugia and
Francesco Accolti of Arezzo, brother of the Florentine chancellor,
and a pupil of Filelfo; Piero Leoni of Spoleto, already
mentioned, who afterwards, to his misfortune, became
Lorenzo’s family doctor; the humanists Lorenzo Lippi of
Colle and Bartolommeo of Pratovecchio. Special honours
fell to the share of the Roman Francesco de’ Massimi, who
came to the university at its opening as professor of law,
was made Principal the next year, and gained such esteem
both by his lectures and by his endeavours to establish and
maintain a better understanding between the two hostile
cities, that the rights of citizenship were conferred on him
and his descendants, and he was permitted to add the arms
of Pisa to his own.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The salaries of the professors were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
mostly considerable, and Lorenzo repeatedly contributed to
them out of his own funds. The archbishop, Filippo de’
Medici, supported him in his efforts to benefit the institution,
which was conducive both to the honour and advantage
of the see. That pecuniary difficulties could not be escaped,
however, is clear from the fact that in 1485, in consequence
of the non-payment of the papal allowance, a retrenchment
of 2,000 florins was deemed needful.</p>

<p>The philosophical and philological lectures continued, as
has been said, at Florence, and scholarly activity there
seemed in nowise diminished by the re-animation of the
sister city. Among the native professors, Bartolommeo della
Fonte (Fontius) made a name equally distinguished in Latin
and Greek literature, and left Latin memoirs on contemporary
events from 1448 to 1493, the value of which is not
to be measured by their brevity.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> His friendship with
Poliziano became clouded when he obtained the chair of
eloquence vacant by Filelfo’s death. He does not seem to
have held it long, as he undertook the superintendence of
Matthias Corvinus’ library at Ofen. The study of Greek
flourished. The chair once occupied by Argyropulos and
Theodoros was filled by the Athenian Demetrios Chalcondylas,
who kept it longer than anyone else, and left a better
reputation, both for learning and morality, than many Greek
grammarians. Poliziano, who is supposed to have perfected
his knowledge of the Hellenic tongue under him, addressed
him in several Greek epigrams, which give no hint of the
rivalry afterwards said to exist between them. A fine testimony
to his Homeric studies is the edition of the ‘Iliad’
and ‘Odyssey’ which came out in 1488. Three years before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
at the age of nearly seventy, he left Florence for Milan,
where he long continued to teach, having been gladly welcomed
by Lodovico Sforza, who rivalled the Medici in his
patronage of science and art. Chalcondylas’ place at
Florence was taken by Johannes Lascaris, who formed many
fruitful connections with Milan, France, and Rome, in the
days of Lorenzo’s son. The knowledge of Greek was, perhaps,
never so widespread among high-born youths anywhere
as in those days in the Tuscan city to which, Poliziano said,
Athens with its native soil and all its possessions had transferred
itself. In truth, strangers eager to learn came from
all quarters&mdash;England, Germany, Portugal&mdash;just as of
old everybody went to Athens. Here Alessandro Farnese
acquired that knowledge of the language and literature
of Greece which the greyhaired Pope Paul III. had not
yet lost. Poliziano thus addressed the hearers of Chalcondylas:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Seek the Pierides not in their ancient home, O ye poets:</p>
<p class="pp6">For in this city of ours dwells now the heavenly choir.</p>
<p class="pp4">Where, do ye ask, have they chosen among us a place to abide in?</p>
<p class="pp6">All the nine ye will find safe in Chalcondylas’ breast.</p>

<p class="p1">Textual criticism was a work taken up less by foreigners
than by Italians: in Rome, especially by Lorenzo Valla and
Pomponio Leto; in Florence, by Landino, Poliziano, and
Pico. Lorenzo not only encouraged those personally intimate
with him to this work, but urged others to it, particularly
the members of the Academy, which, having
weathered the storms of Paul II.’s reign, flourished with
renewed vigour under Sixtus IV., a Pope who felt no fear of
the baptized heathens. Bartolommeo Platina, writing to
Lorenzo<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> to recommend the Milanese sculptor Andrea
Fusina, adds that the man felt assured of obtaining his
desire if he, Platina, interceded for him. ‘Farewell, and
believe me, thou hast few who love and honour thee like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Platina.’ On March 30, 1488, Lorenzo wrote to Lanfredini
on behalf of a friend of Pomponio Leto:<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> ‘Doubtless you
know, at least by name, Pomponio, one of the most famous
scholars in Rome, if not the very first, and a man much
attached to me and our whole house, so that I am greatly
desirous of doing him a favour.’</p>

<p>The art of studying manuscripts had first to be put on a
sound basis. The rich harvest of discoveries was now almost at
an end, a few objects of interest turning up only occasionally.
Collectors had naturally enough given themselves up to
delight in the prizes thus gained, without troubling themselves
much about criticism. The necessity of criticism
became more strongly felt and exercised as continued study
of the old authors involved a stricter examination of the
correctness of the manuscripts. At first people had been too
much inclined to believe generally in their great age, and
had been misled in individual cases by the chronological
notes at the end of the codices. Often, as in the Medicean
codex of the later books of the Annals of Tacitus, the date
was fixed in the fourth Christian century, when in reality
the parchments were written on by a later copyist. The
corrupt state of the manuscripts called for correction, but
the correction was mostly arbitrary. Coluccio Salutati,
Leonardo Bruni, Francesco Barbaro, and others, sought to
supply what was needed, but of rules they knew nothing.
In this, above all, shines the transcendent merit of Poliziano;
though even he indulged largely in conjecture, when in his
youth he self-complacently fancied that his work on Catullus
surpassed everything of the kind. Nor did he stand alone in
this respect. Ermolao Barbaro in his edition of Pliny in
1492, Marullus in his critical works on Lucretius, confess
how often they had had recourse to emendations of their
own devising. But Poliziano thoroughly perceived that a
secure basis was only to be obtained by a comparison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
MSS. where more than one existed. When this was not the
case he tried to get a foundation for his conjectures from
notes and parallel passages. Many printed books from his
library bear on their margins traces of this comparison of
MSS., to which he alludes in one of his letters to Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The collection of critical studies which he published in 1489
under the title of ‘Miscellanea,’ at Lorenzo’s desire and with
a dedication to him, is a lasting memorial of his learning
and acumen. A painful impression is made by his dispute
with Filelfo’s pupil Giorgio Merula,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the editor of ‘Plautus.’
This man had been invited to Milan by Ludovico il Moro,
gave philosophical lectures there, and though previously an
admirer of Poliziano, now professed to find errors and
plagiarisms in his works. Sforza showed his good sense by
trying to calm the irritation of the Florentine when appealed
to by him.</p>

<p>Poliziano’s critical work on the correction of the text of
Justinian’s ‘Corpus Juris’ holds an honourable place in the
history of this subject. This famous copy of the Pandects
was avowedly acquired by Pisa at the conquest of Amalfi,
whither it had doubtless come as a gift from some Greek
emperor, and on the overthrow of Pisa it was transferred to
Florence. Poliziano’s views of its age and authorship may
have been exploded by later criticism, but for the foundations
of a better text than that of the later MSS., and the two
editions printed from them, we still owe him thanks.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>While the Latin works of the humanists were being done
into the vulgar tongue, the practice of translating Greek works
into Latin was continued. Alamanno Rinuccini translated
Plutarch’s ‘Lives’ and moral writings, as well as Philostratos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>’
‘Life of Apollonius of Tyana,’ which excited special interest
in an age much busied with the theologising philosophy of
the later Greeks. Alessandro Bracci did the same for the
histories of Appian, and Poliziano, as has been mentioned,
translated those of Herodian for Innocent VIII. The movement,
begun in Florence and Venice, had spread all over Italy.
In the most palmy days of these studies the invention of
printing produced in the whole world of letters a change, the
possible extent of which was at once felt, though it could not
yet be measured. Books had hitherto been things for the
great and opulent, and not seldom were to be obtained only
by personal labour. There were difficulties even in the
highest circles. The spread of the new art produced not
only a material increase of literary productions, but led
naturally to an immense increase of criticism. In earlier
times bitter complaints had been heard of the corruption of
the texts. The few attempts that had been made to attain
greater correctness now became a recognised branch of study.
Every corrector was not indeed a Poliziano, a Barbaro, or a
Merula. The last complains, in his edition of ‘Plautus’ of
1472, that learned and unlearned alike busied themselves
with correcting books; a circumstance which limits the
value of more than one <i>editio princeps</i> to its mere rarity,
and explains the fact that many of the correctors of that
time rivalled their predecessors the copyists in the arbitrariness
of their proceedings. But even in the case of the
learned the canons of criticism were by no means fixed.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Florence, which, when printing was
introduced into Italy, stood at the head of all literary movement,
is by no means the first city that appears in the annals
of typography. In 1465, three years after the capture of
Mainz by Adolf of Nassau had scattered to the four winds
the printers established there, two Germans set up the first
printing-press in the Benedictine monastery at Subiaco,
whence ere long it was removed to the house of the Massimi
at Rome. Four years later Venice followed, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Umbrian and other cities. In November, 1471, appeared the
first book printed in Florence, the commentary of Servius on
Virgil’s ‘Bucolics,’ which was followed in the following
January by the ‘Georgics,’ and in October, 1472, by the
‘Æneid.’ But if the city fell behind many others in point
of priority, this honour is due to her, that one of her sons
cut and founded his own types, without needing the services
of a foreigner. The goldsmith Bernardo Cennini was the
first Italian who set himself up as an independent artist in
this line.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Born in Florence, January, 1415, he was first a
silk-weaver and then a goldsmith, and was concerned in the
bronze doors of the Baptistery, and other great works. His
art led him to manufacture types for printing. The inscription
in the book printed by him, with the help of his sons
Domenico and Pietro, the first as compositor, the second as
corrector of the press,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> shows that he was proud of the
achievement: ‘To Florentine minds nought is arduous.’
The book shows an artistic mind in its form and typographical
arrangement, but the round type is lacking in sharpness
and evenness. The pecuniary result can scarcely have been
worth the trouble and outlay. When we find that Cennini,
after spending sixteen months on the production of the folio
volume, pledged his house for a loan of 120 florins, we can
understand why he returned to his old occupation, and why
no other book printed by him is forthcoming. In course of
time Bernardo Cennini, whose sight had suffered greatly,
became consul of his guild, and died in 1483, twelve years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
after the attempt which brought him a name and somewhat
tardy honours.</p>

<p>Next a German who had established himself in Florence,
Johannes, son of Peter of Mainz, printed Boccaccio’s ‘Filocolo’
in 1472, and afterwards joined the typographical
society which took its name from the Dominican nunnery at
Ripoli.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Its local habitation is still shown in one of the
schoolrooms of the educational institute named after the
same in the Via della Scala. From this establishment,
founded by the spiritual directors of the convent and connected
with a type-foundry, issued first, in 1476, some lauds
and prayers, then the ‘Commentary of Donatus’ and the
‘Legend of S. Catherine of Siena,’ which, both in the
common form and in copies with illuminated initials, obtained
a great circulation. This printing establishment, in
which many both of the clergy and laity had a share, and in
which the nuns were employed as compositors, produced a
great deal of work during its short existence of eight years.
In 1477 printing was begun by Nicolaus of Breslau, already
mentioned; in 1478 he brought out the ‘editio princeps’
of Celsus, and three years later Landino’s ‘Dante.’ In
1481, Antonio Miscomini printed Savonarola’s ‘Triumphus
Crucis,’ a proof of the increasing notice attracted by the
eloquent and learned Dominican. Next came Ficino’s
‘Platonic Theology,’ and translation of ‘Plotinus.’ In 1488
the series of Greek books issued in Florence opened brilliantly
with the ‘Homer,’ dedicated to Lorenzo’s eldest son.
Chalcondylas undertook the correction, the difficulty of
which called forth his remark, in the preface, that the text
had been so corrupted by the carelessness of copyists that it
was, so to say, impossible to find it entire in any codex,
however old. The expenses were borne by Bernardo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Neri, sons of Tanai de’ Nerli, a noble citizen. Lorenzo
Alopa of Venice is said to have printed the beautiful volume,
which was soon followed by numerous others. The most
celebrated Florentine family of typographers, that of the
Giunta, did not begin their labours till Lorenzo de’ Medici
had long been in his grave.</p>

<p>The extended use of typography had, however, as yet by
no means diminished the value of manuscripts or put an end
to the work of the copyists, while the need and difficulty of
unearthing literary treasures was as great as ever. The explanation
of this is to be found in the material perfection to
which the art of the copyists had been brought, a perfection
of which the proud consciousness was expressed in Vespasiano’s
disdainful remark on printing. This branch of
industry went on flourishing for many years, to disappear at
last and leave scarcely a trace behind. One of the most
brilliant, though not the most important, of the treasures of
the Laurentiana, the works of St. Augustine in sixteen folio
volumes full of miniatures and ornaments, was begun in the
time of Piero de’ Medici and finished shortly before the
death of Lorenzo (two of the volumes are dated 1491). It
may not have been completed till the time of his second son,
unless the escutcheon with the balls and the Triregnum
points to Leo X. only as the possessor of the work and not
as concerned in its execution.</p>

<p>In the diffusion of literary treasures, both of classical
and modern works, and in the relations of the latter to the
general public, who now for the first time became really
acquainted with them, was brought about that great change
which gives to this period double importance in the history
of intellectual development. At Lorenzo’s death this revolution
had hardly reached its first stage; but his keen vision
perceived its growing importance when he observed that in
the course of twenty-eight years Italy had come to take a
more prominent share than other lands in the activity of the
press. This showed, quite as much as the previous rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
development of Greek literature, that the country was ready
to make an independent and profitable use of the gifts of
foreign countries. The invention of printing and the discovery
of America were in some degree the two great landmarks
of Lorenzo’s life. The first created actual publicity,
the second opened a new horizon to the world.</p>

<p>Never were manuscripts more eagerly collected and copied
than in those days. The sum of the collections was not so
great as in the days of Poggio and Leonardo Bruni; still
the libraries were increasing everywhere. Greece, which
had contributed so largely to enrich the West in the first
half of the century, and after the fall of the Eastern empire,
was still the principal mine. Witness the two journeys of
Johannes Lascaris, the second of which, like that of Bernardo
Michelozzi, was entirely devoted to searching the monastery
of Mount Athos. Its results, as already stated, reached
Florence after Lorenzo’s death. As early as 1472 Lorenzo
had projected a building, probably near the palace in the
Via Larga, destined to contain the great number of manuscripts
collected by his grandfather, his father, and himself.
This appears from a letter addressed to him by Vespasiano
da Bisticci, in which the latter recalls their frequent conversations
on the subject, and adds that such an undertaking
would do great honour to Lorenzo as well as to the town;
and that he had written about it to the Duke of Calabria,
the Count of Urbino, and Alessandro Sforza, Lord of Pesaro,
knowing how much pleasure it would give them. Doubtless
the manifold cares and disturbances which prevented Lorenzo
from imitating his grandfather in the number and
splendour of his buildings hindered him from executing this
plan in good time. Consequently at his premature death
the library was but half finished. It is now impossible to
make out even the site of the building, since it is uncertain
whether it was the same chosen many years afterwards by
his nephew Pope Clement VII. for the existing Mediceo-Laurentian
library. We still possess the inventory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
private library of the Medici, drawn up in 1495, when
the books were made over to the convent of San Marco.
There they remained, through many vicissitudes, till 1508,
when Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici bought them and transferred
them to Rome; after his death they returned to
Florence, to form the chief part of the San Lorenzo collection.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>It may be imagined that many of Lorenzo’s fellow-citizens
were his rivals in book-collecting. A fine library
had once been formed by Piero de’ Pazzi, son of Andrea.
Francesco and Angelo Gaddi followed his example, and the
great public library of their native city contains many books
once in their possession. Poliziano’s friend, the accomplished
merchant Filippo Sassetti the elder, also made a large collection.
The good custom of making special bequests to secure
these literary treasures from dispersion was kept up.
Boccaccio had done this, and Riccoli, Traversari, Cardinal
Piero Corsini and others; and in like manner Ugolini Guigni,
Bishop of Volterra, left his books to the Benedictine abbey
at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In 1477, Jacopo Salvini, Bishop of Cortona,
bequeathed his collection to Lorenzo de’ Medici.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The latter
had literary correspondents everywhere. In 1476 we find
him corresponding with the Milanese Gio. Francesco della
Torre, who, with Maestro Bonaccorso of Pisa, had purchased
the books of Andronikos Kallistos, when the latter purposed
returning from Lombardy to his own home.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Giovanni
Rossi of Candia, who had been employed by Cardinal Bessarion,
was also made use of by Lorenzo, apparently to look
after copies of manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Among those more closely
connected with him in later years, Poliziano, Pico, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Ermolao Barbaro took charge of the enrichment of his collection
and that of the convent libraries of San Marco,
Fiesole, and San Gallo. Ho said once to Poliziano, he
wished that he and Pico could procure him so many books
that his income would not suffice to buy them, and he should
be obliged to pawn his household goods. He kept copyists
in many places, especially at Padua, which, as the residence
of so many great scholars and from its connection with the
Levant through Venice, was a spot favourable to book
collectors.</p>

<p>The difficulty and expense of obtaining manuscripts in
earlier times has been already noticed. Even in Lorenzo’s
latter years it was by no means easy, and his correspondence
shows that once, in the very height of his glory, he had to
apply in his own handwriting to a prince who was probably
under obligation to him, in order to obtain the loan of Dion
Cassius. ‘There is in your Excellency’s library,’ he wrote
on February 5, 1486, to Duke Ercole d’Este, ‘a historian,
by name Dio, <i>de Romanis historiis</i>, that I earnestly desire to
see, both on account of the enjoyment and consolation which
history affords me, and because my son Piero, who has some
knowledge of Greek literature, has begged me to help him
to become acquainted with this author, who, I understand,
is very rare in Italy. Your Excellency can understand how
highly I shall prize the favour, if you will lend me the book
for a few days.’ Notwithstanding their intimacy, the Duke
did not send the original, but allowed a copy to be made by
a copyist sent to Ferrara for the purpose. Two years later
he had Niccolò Leoniceno’s translation copied for Lorenzo,
on condition that it was neither to be printed nor allowed to
go any further.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> In the spring of 1491 Poliziano was, as
we have seen, in Venice, where he bought for his patron a
quantity of manuscripts now in the Laurentiana. He was
refused permission to see Cardinal Bessarion’s collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
books, although the Ferrarese ambassador used his influence
with the Doge Agostino Barbarigo&mdash;a strange token of petty
mistrust.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> ‘Your diligence in having Greek works copied,
and the favour you show to scholars,’ wrote Poliziano to
Lorenzo about this time, ‘procures for you such honour and
attachment as no one has enjoyed for many years past.’ He
mentioned at the same time the admiration for Lorenzo expressed
by a Venetian poetess honoured by all scholars and
literary men, as well as by popes and kings. ‘Last
evening I visited Cassandra Fedele,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to whom I presented
your salutations, Lorenzo; she is really admirable, both in
Latin and in the vulgar tongue, withal very modest, and, in
my opinion, also beautiful. I left her astonished. She is
devoted to you, and speaks of you as if she knew all about
you. Some day she will certainly come to Florence to visit
you, so prepare to do her honour.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s example did not fail to bring forth fruit in his
own house. Leo X. laboured all his life to follow it, with a
zeal in collecting which showed that his father’s spirit survived
in him. Piero, with his tutor Poliziano, superintended the
arrangement and enrichment of the library, sending reports
about it to his father, when the latter was ill at the baths. We
learn from one of his letters<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> that the Medici, in the interests
of their library, took advantage of the death of King Matthias
Corvinus (April 4, 1490) to secure a number of his copyists
and agents who were then thrown out of employment. That
monarch vied with the book collectors of his time, and spent
more than 30,000 gold florins yearly on the increase of his
library at Ofen. In 1488 he sent an agent to Florence with
full power to make purchases and superintend the taking of
copies. The efforts made by this active and high-minded
ruler of a people still half barbarous, however capable of development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
were always assisted by Lorenzo, as became his
friendly relations with Matthias. Long before the days of
Matthias Corvinus there had been a literary and artistic
connection between Florence and Hungary through Filippo
Scolari, commonly called Pippo Spano by his countrymen,
from his title of Count Palatine (<i>Obergespann</i>) of Temesvar;
he held an influential position under Sigismund of Luxemburg.
The connection with the Italian literary world had
been actively kept up by the powerful Archbishop of Gran,
Johann Vitez, who founded a high school at Ofen; still
more by his nephew, Janus Pannonius, Bishop of Fünfkirchen,
who studied at Padua under Guarino, and visited
Cosimo de’ Medici at Careggi.</p>

<p>From his youth Lorenzo had extended his attention beyond
what are called literary treasures in the narrower sense.
In another field, bordering at once on the study of antiquity
and on that of history, his name must also be mentioned
with distinction. The range of classical studies was extended
to ancient monuments. Rome, for centuries active only in
destruction, began to be ashamed of the bad name which
such barbarism had brought upon her. The time of Sixtus
IV., with all its sins, was the turning-point. Like his successor
and namesake, Sixtus V., the Pope did not entirely
refrain from demolishing ancient monuments; but works of
art and inscriptions were safe. The Roman Academy strove
to wipe out the blot pointed at in an epigram by Pius II.</p>

<p>The great increase in the collection of old inscriptions drew
attention to those valuable witnesses of old times. At the
same time the disappearance of these memorials through
decay and careless removal gave warning that their contents
must be secured by copying. What had been once undertaken
by Nicola Signorini, Giovanni Dondi, Poggio, Ciriaco,
perhaps even before them by Cola di Rienzi, was now continued
under the guidance of Pomponio Leto and his friends,
with the sympathy of all Italy. Inscribed stones were diligently
collected in Rome, Naples, and northern Italy. Bernardo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Rucellai copied a number of epigraphs from the originals
in Rome. One of the most valuable of these collections of
transcriptions was dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici by its
author, the Dominican Fra Giocondo of Verona. He was
one of those many-sided geniuses frequent at the time;
versed in classical literature and in knowledge of antiquity.
His pupil, Julius Cæsar Scaliger, called him a living library
of ancient and modern learning. He was an engineer and
architect, active in many ways at Rome, at Venice, and in
France, and at an advanced age master-builder of the Vatican
Basilica, under Leo X. The copy of the collection of inscriptions
presented by Fra Giocondo to Lorenzo de’ Medici,
who came in contact with him through Alessandro Cortesi,
has disappeared, but other copies remain. The dedication
of the work is an eloquent lamentation over the state of
ancient Rome, and over the dispersion or destruction of stone
and bronze tablets. It offers a warm tribute to their value,
and an acknowledgment of Lorenzo’s interest in these
studies. Poliziano and other friends made use of the careful
work of the energetic Veronese, who was in communication
both with the future Pope and his brother Giuliano, to
whom he dedicated his commentary on Cæsar’s ‘Gallic War,’
and the later edition of ‘Vitruvius.’<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Such were the literary tendencies which, notwithstanding
the rivalry of other cities, had their chief centre and
focus at Florence; such was the circle of men which had
gathered together in this city. Vacant places were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
filled up again. Like Lorenzo himself, several of the most
prominent were in the prime of life, and younger men began
to make good their claims. Such were Marcello Virgilio
Adriani, who, after Scala’s death, restored the chancellorship
to its pristine glory, and Bernardo Dovizj, who grew up
in the house of the Medici, and afterwards gained a worldwide
reputation as Cardinal of Bibiena. Whatever personal
divergences there might be in the group, Lorenzo held them
all together: all did homage to him, all acknowledged him
as their leader. It was no cringing homage to a mighty
lord; many of those who stood nearest to him gained little
in worldly goods by their position, and others were too high
and independent to need his help. It was the homage due
to a richly endowed mind with noble aims and endeavours.
Regardless of all inequalities of rank and position, freedom
and ease reigned in this circle. When the meetings were
academical, they were free from the formality which afterwards
crept into academical life. Lorenzo de’ Medici, cheerful
and sociable, maintained unconstrained intercourse with
his literary friends. He received them everywhere: in the
house in Via Larga, in the garden of San Marco, in the
villas at Careggi and Poggio a Cajano. The more intimate
of them accompanied him also when he went to the baths or
to Pisa, or when he paced the convent cloisters in serious
discourse with the clergy. The Platonic Academy, an inheritance
from his grandfather, was only one manifestation
of this multiform social life. It was so strangely composed
that it is not surprising the Platonists sometimes fell into
very un-Platonic ways. There is something half comic about
a letter of Landino’s dated 1464, the year Cosimo died;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> it
is a petition on behalf of the herald of the Priory Palace,
who had been dismissed from his post for keeping a girl
hidden two days in his room. He solicits pardon upon the
following pleas: his wife was expecting her confinement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he had two little daughters and an aged mother, and was a
member of the Platonic Academy.</p>

<p>Lorenzo sometimes took part in the meetings of the
learned society, which he was fond of summoning to Careggi,
being less disturbed there than in the city. In both places
the Symposia were renewed which, according to Alexandrian
tradition, were to celebrate the day of Plato’s birth and
death (November 7). Marsilio Ficino has described one of
these banquets which took place under the presidency either
of Lorenzo or Francesco Bandini.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Among the guests were
Marsilio and his father, Landino, Antonio degli Agli Bishop
of Fiesole, Carlo and Cristoforo Marsuppini, Giovanni Cavalcanti,
Bernardo Nuzzi, and Tommaso Benci. The academical
celebration or exercise succeeded the repast. Plato’s
‘Symposion’&mdash;the book which treats of the tokens of love
at similar happy meetings, and a commentary on which
Marsilio furnished in his treatise on love&mdash;was used as a
starting-point for free disputation, the parts being divided
among the persons present. Giovanni Cavalcanti developed
the ‘Phædro,’ and showed how the birth of Eros from the
conjunction of the earth with chaos, amid the throes of
creation and the struggle for light, signified the original
motive force of all that is good, noble, and beautiful in mankind.
With this discourse was connected the exposition,
also allotted to Cavalcanti, of the speech of Pausanias on
the double Aphrodite, and Urania; on the distinction and
confusion between moral and physical affections, their emanation,
extension, stages of purification, and participation in
the manifold forces of nature. Landino undertook to explain
the speech of Aristophanes. According to this, love
is the never-sleeping longing of man for a return to his
former state of oneness with the Divine, from which Zeus, in
wrath, had divided him by means of his earthly form and by
sin. To Carlo Marsuppini fell the discourse of Agathon,
which glorifies the qualities of the god who is at once so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
various and yet blends all variety into unity. Tommaso
Benci devoted himself to pointing out the connection between
the Christian view and the supposed inspired words of the
priestess Diotima, who disclosed to Socrates the nature of a
love that raises man to the highest good or sinks him to the
lowest depths of evil. Cristoforo Marsuppini undertook to
bring into harmony with the Socratic doctrine of Love the
poems of Guido Cavalcanti, to which, as an emanation of
Greek philosophy in the arena of the new-born Italian
literature, great importance was attached by contemporaries,
especially by Lorenzo de’ Medici. Such were the occupations
of these famous assemblies. Their positive scientific results
were not great, yet they afford a brilliant testimony to the
cultivation which enabled the upper classes in Florence to
take part in the noblest intellectual efforts.</p>

<p>While poetry and philosophy were thus flourishing, the
exact sciences were making considerable progress. It is
doubtful whether Fra Luca Paciolo, of Borgo San Sepolcro&mdash;who
first recalled true geometry to life by his exposition of
Euclid, and who exercised so much influence on Leonardo
da Vinci&mdash;began his labours during the lifetime of Lorenzo.
But Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli, the physician, philosopher,
naturalist, and mathematician, commenced his studies as
early as the days of Cosimo the Elder. In 1468 he laid
down the famous meridian in Sta. Maria del Fiore, primarily
for the purpose of ascertaining exactly the solstices in order
to fix the festivals of the Church. The importance of the
work was appreciated by later generations, and the task was
performed more perfectly 300 years afterwards, at the suggestion
of La Condamine.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> It is well known that Toscanelli,
who died in 1482, aged seventy-five, exerted great influence
on the mind of Christopher Columbus by his calculations of
the longitudinal extent of Eastern Asia, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
rested chiefly on Marco Polo’s mistaken hypotheses. Long
after Toscanelli’s death, Columbus&mdash;when upon his first
voyage&mdash;made use of the map, marked with the latitudes
and longitudes, which the former had once sent to Lisbon.
It was in the last years of Lorenzo’s life that a man whose
name is more famous than his deeds, and who has been the
subject of renewed controversy in our own times, left his
home to seek a new one in Southern Spain.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The family of
Amerigo Vespucci, which reckoned among the navigator’s
near relatives men of both scientific and political importance,
was sometimes on friendly, sometimes on hostile terms
with the Medici; but we hear nothing of any personal relation
between him and Lorenzo. About the age of forty,
Amerigo settled in Seville, where he joined the banking and
commercial house of his fellow-countryman Giovanni Berardi.
Well furnished with knowledge, to which his learned uncle
Giorgio Antonio had contributed not a little, he began a
course of practical preparations for the undertaking which
led him to the Far West. Not with the Florentines, but with
a schoolman of Lorraine, originated the name of the new
continent which, as long as the world stands, will recall
Amerigo Vespucci. Still the Florentines rightly rejoiced in
the fame of their countryman. A later generation has seen
the house of his forefathers turned into a hospital, and has
inscribed on it in homage to his memory: ‘Ob repertam
Americam sui et patriæ nominis illustratori amplificatori
orbis terrarum.’ When the news of his discoveries made in
the voyage of 1497 reached Florence, the Signoria had the
above-named house illuminated for three nights, a distinction
they were wont to bestow only on the most conspicuous merit.</p>

<p class="pch">COSIMO AND PIERO DE’ MEDICI IN THEIR RELATION TO ART.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> early years of Cosimo de’ Medici were passed during
the great revolution in art by which realism, united with
reminiscences of the antique, enforced its claims, and, superseding
the Gothic and Pisan styles in architecture and
sculpture, restricted that of Giotto, in painting, to a narrow
circle of recognised types. Art had struck out for itself
these new paths before Cosimo became ruler of the whole
state; but he influenced its rapid development by his active
sympathy and by a liberality rarely equalled by private individuals
or even by princes. Independently of the encouragement
he afforded to talent in his princely capacity, he gave
honourable commissions to artists from his own resources.
In personal intercourse with them he united a thorough
knowledge of art with a sympathetic affability which did
equal honour to them and to himself. His two favourite
architects, Brunelleschi and Michelozzo, have been already
mentioned. The former died eighteen years before him,
the latter survived him about six years. He justly valued
their genius, and promoted a friendly understanding between
them while employing both on important works. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Brunelleschi who continued the building of the church of
San Lorenzo and the abbey of Fiesole.</p>

<p>After the days of Giovanni di Bicci both branches of the
Medici seem to have been reunited. The church of San
Lorenzo was the parish church of Cosimo’s branch, and the
burial-place of both. As early as 1415 there had been a
talk of enlarging this sacred edifice, which dated from the
earliest years of Christianity. Three years later a street at
the back, the Via de’ Preti&mdash;a name ill-suited to the occupations
of its inhabitants&mdash;was assigned to the Chapter for the
purpose of enlargement. They began to rebuild the choir
in 1419.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> With other members of wealthy families, Giovanni
de’ Bicci, having pledged himself to build some chapels,
undertook the sacristy, which, for harmony of proportions,
both in its cupola and ground-plan, and for the excellence of
its decorations, claims the highest admiration. What the
father had begun the son continued on a larger scale. On
September 23, 1440&mdash;while the building of the new church
was proceeding under the direction of Brunelleschi, the
older one still being in use&mdash;Cosimo buried his brother
Lorenzo there. Upon this occasion Pope Eugene IV. sent
the cardinals and prelates of his court with the banner of
the church and his own, and 100 wax candles. Two years
later Cosimo proceeded to complete the choir and cupola on
condition of gaining the right of patronage for himself and
his heirs, in return for which privilege he gave the chapter
a state bond for 40,000 florins towards the expenses of the
building. On May 15, 1457, the court of the Canonica was
begun; it was finished, as well as the high altar and those
in the transepts, four years after, and finally the high altar
was consecrated by Archbishop Orlando Bonarli on August
9, 1461. Two years before, a college for young clergy had
been opened near the church, which retains its chapter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
this day.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> San Lorenzo is a basilica with columns. It has
arches resting on an entablature laid on the capitals, a
square end to the choir, a cupola, a flat roof, and chapels
of no great depth. A walk through the cloisters of the
Canonica recalls times long gone by. Two ranges of arcades
enclose the quadrangle and lead to the little dwellings of the
canons and to the famous library, which, in its present form,
is a work of later days. The mighty dome of the cathedral
and the bell-tower of Giotto look down into these cloisters,
the stillness of which contrasts with the din of the busy
streets around; while its whole appearance reminds the
spectator of the homely simplicity, the frugality, and noble
generosity which prevailed at the time of its erection.</p>

<p>The work said to have been executed for Cosimo at Fiesole
by Brunelleschi was scarcely less important. At the foot of
the hill there, in the valley of the Mugnone, lay the old abbey
church, believed to be the original cathedral of the Etruscan
city. In 1439, by command of Pope Eugene IV., it was
handed over by the Benedictines to the regular canons of
St. Augustine; and Cosimo de’ Medici, who was a friend of
the Prior&mdash;Don Timoteo of Verona&mdash;began the new building.
The church still retains the middle compartment of its
original façade, belonging to the præ-Gothic period. Containing
a nave and chapels of considerable dimensions, the
building is simple and artistic. Doubts have been thrown
on Vasari’s assertion that it is really Brunelleschi’s, it being
quite unlike his other works.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The building of the convent
presented many difficulties on account of the slope of the
ground, and was finished by Cosimo’s son in 1466. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
long been diverted from its original use, but continued to be
the domicile of the founder and his family, whose arms were
carved upon it, at a later period. Here the Platonic Academy
held its meetings, and here a great-grandson of Cosimo
donned the purple as cardinal, and another&mdash;Giuliano, Duke
of Nemours&mdash;drew his last breath. In later days the church
was enriched with many beautiful works of art; but in vain
do we look round the great building, which neither Brunelleschi
nor Cosimo lived to see completed, for the learned
men and the collection of books that were once in a double
sense its best ornaments.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Brunelleschi’s work in the neighbourhood of the city was
surpassed in grandeur by a building of Michelozzo’s within
the walls. In 1436 the Medici brothers obtained from Pope
Eugene IV. the cession of the Silvestrine<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> convent of San
Marco to the Dominicans of Fiesole, who had just settled
beside the little church of San Giorgio, on the left bank of
the Arno. In the following year the rebuilding of the convent
and restoration of the church was begun; not without
difficulties on the part of the former owners, who actually
entered a protest at the Council of Basle. The cost of reconstruction
was borne mainly by the Medici, with some assistance
from the community. The church was consecrated
on the feast of the Epiphany, 1442, by Cardinal Acciapacci,
Archbishop of Capua, in presence of the Pope and his court.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
A considerable portion of the convent was finished in 1443;
but the whole was not completed till eight years later. The
traces of Michelozzo’s hand are no longer to be seen in the
church; the choir and apse were rebuilt two hundred years
after him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to walk through the great courts, the
broad vaulted corridors, the endless rows of cells opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
into the passages, and the noble library, without remembering
that this convent was the scene of many famous events
in peace and war that influenced the fate of the city, and
left their mark in the history not of Italy only, but of the
human mind.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Cosimo was continually employing Michelozzo,
who, besides the family palace, built for him the Noviciate
of Sta. Croce and the adjoining chapel; remodelled the
villas at Careggi, Cafaggiuolo, and Trebbio, and executed
other works, some of them beyond the Tuscan border.
Among the latter was the decoration of the palace at Milan,
entrusted to him by Francesco Sforza, for which purpose
Michelozzo visited that city. Here also he built for Pigello
Portinari, director of the Medicean bank, a chapel in Sant’
Eustorgio after the model of that of the Pazzi in Sta. Croce.
Cosimo’s sons employed him likewise. He is commonly believed
to have designed for Piero the elegant chapel of the
Annunziata, over whose altar hangs the thirteenth century
picture of the Annunciation, which gave rise to the building
of the church. This building, a quadrangular open chapel,
with fluted Corinthian columns of marble supporting a
richly decorated entablature, and enclosed by an elegant
brass trellis, was executed by Pagno di Lapo Partigiani, a
sculptor of Fiesole, and consecrated by Cardinal Guillaume
d’Estouteville, Archbishop of Rouen, on Christmas day,
1452.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>About the same time, Michelozzo executed for Piero the
marble tabernacle destined to contain a figure of Christ in
the nave of the basilica of San Miniato. It consists of a
canopy supported on composite marble columns and pilasters,
the interior richly decorated with rose-coloured ornaments of
glazed earth in square panels. On the frieze is the Medicean
device, the three feathers with the diamond ring and the
motto <i>Semper</i>, on the arch the escutcheon of the Calimala
guild, in relief. Inside the tabernacle stands the altar with
painting and <i>predella</i>.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> For Giovanni, Cosimo’s younger
son, Michelozzo built on the heights of Fiesole a villa, visible
from a great distance, which afterwards passed to the Mozzi
family. The architect was also employed by connections of
the Medici. For Giovanni Tornabuoni he built the great
palace near Sta. Trinità, which still gives its name to the
street. To gain more space, it afterwards became necessary
to demolish the front part of this palace, which, with its
ground floor of rustic-work and its plain arched windows, had
a somewhat sombre effect.</p>

<p>While Michelozzo’s time was chiefly taken up by the
Medici, Brunelleschi was active in other quarters. The progress
and final completion of his great work, the dome of
the cathedral, has already been mentioned. On August 30,
1436, the roofing-in was celebrated by the pealing of all the
bells in the city and the chanting of a <i>Te Deum</i>. Eight
years later the scaffolding was raised for building the lantern,
which was begun in 1446, shortly before the death of the
great master, who was succeeded by Michelozzo.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> His
beautiful arcade at the Foundling Hospital has been mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The similar loggia of San Paolo was placed opposite
Sta. Maria Novella, at the southern end of the piazza.
He built a chapel for the Pazzi family in the front court of
the convent of Sta. Croce. Its walls are covered with
Corinthian pilasters, high niches, and terra-cotta alto-rilievos;
the cupola rests on two side-arches richly panelled and
decorated with designs in glazed earth; the pendants being
ornamented with terra-cotta rilievos of the Evangelists.
Decoration and colour are here kept just within the limits of
good taste. Andrea de’ Pazzi began the building, which
was finished by his son Jacopo, so that Brunelleschi can
hardly have lived to see its completion.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The official residence
of the Capitani di parte Guelfa in the Via delle Terme,
rebuilt by Brunelleschi, still exists, though with many alterations.
The architect saw only the beginnings of his second
greatest work, the palace of Luca Pitti. In Vasari’s time,
when Eleonora di Toledo, Duchess of Florence, purchased
the unfinished building&mdash;appropriately called, by an art-writer
of those days, <i>muraglia</i>&mdash;the original plan was no
longer to be found. Many alterations were made in succeeding
centuries down to the present, when the extensive wings,
intended as halls, were built. But the façade has kept its
original stamp, and Vasari’s words remain true&mdash;that Tuscan
architecture has produced no richer or grander creation.
This grandeur is united with the greatest simplicity;
and it is the absence of all ornament upon the three
stages of rustic-work, with their gigantic bow-windows,
crowned with galleries, which gives the building its peculiar
character. The palace is said to have been begun in 1440,
long before the time of Luca Pitti’s ephemeral greatness.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
His villa at Rusciano was begun about the time of Brunelleschi’s
death, so that the great artist saw little of the execution
of his plan, which was carried on by Luca Fancelli.
While Brunelleschi here aimed at attaining the whole effect
by the majesty and harmony of the proportions, in the
palace of Jacopo de’ Pazzi he allowed more play to decoration.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Cosimo de’ Medici employed the
most learned artist of the time, Leon Batista Alberti. His
chief works in Florence, with one exception, were executed
for the Rucellai. Among them may be mentioned the palace,
the loggia, the upper part of the façade of Sta. Maria Novella,
finished in 1470; and the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre
at San Pancrazio, an imitation of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The Rucellai palace, in which are
retained the bow-windows divided by small columns, points
to the days of Bramante. It exhibits a combination of flat
decorative pilasters of various orders with smooth rustic-work,
antique ornaments on the rectangular doors, and traces
of the square form in the bow-windows. Alberti also made
designs for another work, which has given occasion to so
many objections that its defects have been attributed to
alterations by another hand. This is the choir of the Annunziata,
commenced in 1451 by Lodovico Gonzaga, Marquis
of Mantua, who, as victorious commander-in-chief of the
Republic, desired to found a memorial at once of his piety
and his thankfulness. A quarter of a century elapsed before
the building was finished by Luca Fancelli. The exterior is
octagonal, the interior round, with several chapels in irregular
order, and numerous windows round the base of the large
cupola, which is closed, and was ornamented in the seventeenth
century with figures in fresco. In our own day redecoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
has given to the choir as well as the rest of this
dazzlingly-gilt church a thoroughly modern appearance.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Sculpture, no less than architecture, was in full activity.
Here also we find in the foremost rank those artists whom
the Medici had attached to themselves; among whom
Donatello stood first, while his pupils benefited by the favour
shown to him. The Medici mansion was full of Donatello’s
works. Over the arches in the front court are eight medallions
by him, with reliefs in marble; and he restored
many of the antique heads over the doors. His other works
are all scattered. During Cosimo’s exile, the bronze David
with his foot on the head of Goliath was taken away and
set up in the palace-yard of the Signoria. The owner seems
to have been shy of reclaiming it, and finally, in May 1476,
his grandsons sold it to the municipality.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> During the
second exile of the Medici, another work of Donatello’s was
taken from their house and placed at the great gate of the
same palace, with an inscription recalling the events of
1494.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This is the group of Judith and Holofernes, full of
expression, but forced and offending against the rules of
plastic composition. A loss to be regretted is that of the
bronze bust of Madonna Contessina, which Donatello executed
for her husband.</p>

<p>San Lorenzo still contains many of his works, placed
there by the indefatigable benefactor of this church. Besides
the decorations of the sacristy, &amp;c., there are the reliefs
on the pulpits; artistically they are in fault by their superabundance
and want of repose, but the fault is one of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
man of talent. In point of technical execution, they show a
distinct retrogression when compared with contemporary
works. It was not only in works of this kind that Donatello
displayed an extravagance that belies the sense of beauty.
He did so even in the dancing children executed in marble
relief for the organ at Sta. Maria del Fiore.</p>

<p>Vespasiano da Bisticci describes Cosimo’s attachment to
this man. ‘He was,’ says he,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> ‘a great friend of Donatello,
and of all painters and sculptors. Finding there was little
work for the latter, and not liking Donatello to remain
inactive, he entrusted to him the pulpits and the doors of
the sacristy at San Lorenzo; giving orders that whatever he
needed for his own requirements and those of his four assistants
should be paid to him weekly from the Medici bank.’
As Donatello did not dress to Cosimo’s liking, the latter presented
him with a cloak and hood, an upper garment to
wear under the cloak, and a whole suit, sending all this to
him on the morning of a feast day. Donatello put the new
things on a few times only, declining to wear them any
longer, lest ‘people should think he had grown effeminate.’
How thoroughly Donatello was regarded as belonging to the
Medici household is shown by the fact that the Marquis
Ludovico Gonzaga once asked Cosimo to send the artist to
Mantua to execute a shrine modelled in 1450, to be set up
during the expected visit of Pope Pius II.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Many other
artists were on confidential terms with Cosimo and his
family. Michelozzo’s two sons belonged almost to the
family circle. In the last years of Cosimo, Donatello could
no longer work, so his generous patron maintained him, and
recommended him to his son Piero. The latter gave him a
farm, as he said, ‘to provide him with bread and wine.’ The
artist, however, gave back the gift in legal form, not wishing
to embitter his life with household cares; whereupon Piero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had the value of the produce assigned to him at the bank.
In 1462 Piero granted him space for a vault in San Lorenzo,
near the sacristy; and here, where so many of his works
are to be seen, he was buried in 1468, not far from those
who had so valued him during life.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>After Donatello, most closely connected with the Medici,
father and son, were two masters who, while fairly admitting
the claims of the realistic principle, carried it out in a different
spirit and in more ideal forms. Lorenzo Ghiberti,
who finished the second door of the Baptistery in 1452, with
the help of his son Vettorio, and in spite of his seventy-two
years, undertook the commission for a third. He continued
till the later years of Cosimo busily engaged on the rich
silver reredos, in which Michelozzo, Verocchio, Bernardo
Cennini, Antonio Pollaiuolo, and others, had a share. He
also designed the great rose-window of Sta. Maria del Fiore,
at which Francesco di Domenico Livi of Gambassi, who
learned glass-painting in Germany, was working in 1436,
and Bernardo di Francesco in 1443. Glass-painting in the
true sense of the word was then just beginning to flourish;
until that time coloured windows had been produced by
simply putting variously tinted glass together in mosaic
patterns. Many trod in the steps of Francesco Livi: notably
Ser Guasparre da Volterra, who worked in the cathedral at
Siena; while in Florence, Pisa, and Arezzo, the art was
practised by the Jesuates of the order of the B. Giovanni
Colombini, who were established in Florence in 1438, in the
convent of San Giusto before Porta Pinti, and there built
the great church which was pulled down in 1529. It was
chiefly by them that Sta. Maria del Fiore, Sta. Croce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
San Michele, and other buildings, were glazed with coloured
windows.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>In 1440 Ghiberti finished for the cathedral the shrine of
St. Zanobi, one of his finest works. To Piero de’ Medici he
furnished goldsmith’s work which brought him great admiration
and commissions from Pope Eugene IV. Besides
this master, now growing old, the Medici employed a younger
one, Luca della Robbia. His style is graceful rather than
grand; full of tender and lively expression of feeling, and
pleasing execution in drapery and grouping. His works in
the cathedral show equal fertility of invention and technical
skill. One is the marble relief for the organ gallery, representing
a boy and girl playing and dancing, executed in
1438 as a companion-piece to that of Donatello;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and the
other, not so good, is the door of the sacristy, finished in
1463, with its bronze reliefs of the Madonna, the Evangelists,
and the Fathers of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The monument to Benozzo
Federighi, Bishop of Fiesole<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> (who died in 1450), with the
figure lying on the bier, displays his capabilities in this
direction. But Luca della Robbia is less distinguished by
his sculptures in marble and brass than by the reliefs in
glazed earth which, called after him, were supplied by his
descendants for 100 years. They still abound in Florence
and the whole of Tuscany, even to the mountain convents of
the Apennines and the modest churches of remote towns,
while numbers of them have wandered into foreign lands.
Anyone taking a walk in Florence may enjoy these charming
creations: lunettes or groups above the doors of churches
and houses, medallions of infants on the portico of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Foundling Hospital, heads of saints, tabernacles, heraldic
escutcheons, some plain white on a blue ground, some with
a judicious mixture of colours and a rich border of entwined
leaves and fruit. These works form an almost inexhaustible
treasury, with a marked character of graceful earnestness
and truth to nature; a help to architecture as long as the
decorative element kept its place in the old manner, which
in the fourteenth century employed both glass and colour.
But they were invaluable for interior decoration, for which
Brunelleschi used work in ‘Terra della Robbia’ in the Pazzi
chapel. Luca himself decorated for Cosimo de’ Medici a
room in his palace and the buildings in Sta. Croce, and for
Piero the tabernacle in San Miniato; in the latter church
he also assisted in giving to the chapel of the Cardinal of
Portugal the charm of harmonious perfection.</p>

<p>In the last years of Cosimo de’ Medici grew up a whole
generation of younger sculptors. Their most important
works are sepulchral monuments, which became richer and
grander as time went on. Formerly people had, as a rule,
been content with sarcophagi more or less decorated, like
that of Noferi, the father of Palla Strozzi, who died in 1418
and is buried in the sacristy of Sta. Trinità, beneath an arch
resting on elegant corbels, and on the edges of which are
seen pretty genii playing. Twenty or thirty years later
these simple monuments were still the most usual, even for
men of importance. Neri Capponi lies in the church of the
Santo Spirito in a marble coffin bearing on the front his
portrait in relief between two genii; Orlando de’ Medici
rests in that of the SS. Annunziata in a sarcophagus ornamented
with his coat of arms, and occupying with rich
architectural accessories the whole side of a chapel. These
were both works of Simone, whom tradition makes a brother
of Donatello.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But talented artists soon attempted greater
things. Desiderio da Settignano (so called after the pleasantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
situated little village, two miles east of the city, where
Michel Angelo was nursed by a stonemason’s wife) was a
pupil of Donatello, and thus came into contact with the
Medici, who employed him in San Lorenzo. In the Strozzi
palace may be seen his fine thoughtful marble bust of
Marietta, daughter of Filippo Strozzi the elder and Fiammetta
Adimari. His masterpiece is the monument of Carlo
Marsuppini in Sta. Croce, a figure of the dead man resting
on the sarcophagus in a niche crowned by a lunette, with a
Madonna in relief.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Notwithstanding some overloading in
the accessories, it shows what he might have become had he
not died in 1464, at the early age of thirty-six. The sarcophagus,
resting on lions’ claws and richly adorned with
flowers, leaves, and streaming ribands, is one of the most
beautiful productions of decorative sculpture. Desiderio
had many emulators, to whom we owe some of the finest
monuments of this kind. Among them were the brothers
Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino. The former, who worked
a good deal out of Florence as architect to the Popes, does
not seem to have been employed by the Medici. The only
thing he is said to have done for them is a marble fountain,
decorated with children and dolphins, in one of the courts of
their palace; and of its fate nothing is known. But the
city contains excellent works by both, exhibiting a similarity
to Della Robbia’s style. Two of Bernardo’s works are the
graceful monument to Beata Villana in Sta. Maria Novella,
and that of Leonardo Bruni in Sta. Croce.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
proportions, and technical finish of these works entitle them
to rank among the best productions of a period rich in
monuments. The most perfect work of the kind, however,
is that by Antonio Rossellino to the Cardinal of Portugal, in
San Miniato al Monte. James of Portugal, nephew of King
Alfonso V., had come in bad health to Florence, where he
died in 1459 aged twenty-six. In the basilica, then belonging
to the Olivetans, where he was buried, was built a
chapel, unrivalled in symmetry of form and beauty of detail.
The roof is set off with reliefs in glazed earth, the walls are
inlaid with marble, the altar, the bishop’s throne, and the
floor of <i>opus Alexandrinum</i> are admirable. What was formerly
the altar-piece&mdash;by Pollaiuolo&mdash;is now in the Uffizi.
The monument stands in a large niche, with a curtain
slightly drawn back. The sarcophagus is an imitation of
the coffer afterwards used for the tomb of Pope Clement XII.
in the Lateran. The figure of the departed, wearing his
mitre, rests on a pall held by two seated boys; an architectural
wall-drapery is terminated by a cornice, at each end of
which is a kneeling angel bearing a crown and a palm-branch;
in the arch above are the Virgin and Child surrounded
by a rich garland and upheld by angels in relief.
The figure of the cardinal surpasses all else of its kind in
grace, dignity, and beauty, while in technical work it is perfection.
The head and the folded hands were modelled from
nature.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> A blessed peace seems diffused over the whole
figure, which realizes what Vespasiano da Bisticci says of
the departed, whom he had known in life: ‘He was outwardly
handsome, but his soul was more beautiful than his
body; and by the holiness of his life and conversation he
was fitted to stand beside the saints of old.’<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>To these artists must be added Mino da Fiesole, who,
though a pupil of Desiderio da Settignano&mdash;his senior only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
by a few years&mdash;seemed to have formed himself more on the
model of Donatello. His groups of figures in relief, of which
the chief are at Rome, are not always happy; his monumental
statues, of which the two most remarkable in Florence
are of later date, have great dignity and beauty. In his
portrait-heads there is a peculiar delicacy and truth, indicating
careful study of nature, and of which the bust of Bishop
Leonardo Salutati, in the cathedral of Fiesole, is an excellent
example.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> In the Medici house were busts by him
of Piero and his wife, the former of which is now in the
Uffizi. In ornamentation, particularly in arabesque, Mino
is inferior to none; and it is impossible to mistake his influence
in this respect at Rome, where, from the time of
Nicolas V., the number of monuments rapidly increased.
The works of Giuliano da Majano in Florence, where he
was occupied in 1463-1465 with inlaid woodwork for San
Domenico, near Fiesole, and the sacristy of Sta. Maria del
Fiore, are of much less importance. Neither he nor Antonio
Filarete, founder of the great door of St. Peter’s, are known
to have done any work for the Medici. That the latter was
one of their <i>protégés</i>, however, may be seen not only by the
dedication to Piero of his treatise on architecture, but also
by a letter addressed by him to Piero from Milan, December
20, 1451, thanking him for a recommendation to Francesco
Sforza: ‘I am at your service for whatever I can do. Dispose
of me as you please. Commend me to his Excellency your
father, and your brother Giovanni. With God’s help, I hope
to do honour here both to myself and you; I say to you,
because for your sake and in consequence of your recommendation
his Lordship shows me great favour. He thinks
of appointing me chief architect to the cathedral, which
naturally meets with opposition, I being a stranger; but I
hope they will yield to their lord’s desire.’<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The goldsmith’s art, which in the preceding century had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
reached great perfection in Tuscan cities and was closely
connected with sculpture, attained through niello-work to
engraving on copperplate. The name of Maso Finiguerra,
who executed the celebrated pyx for the Baptistery in 1452,
is inseparable from the history of the Medicean splendour.</p>

<p>For painting, whether in its general development or its
particular productions, the period under consideration is
less important than for the sister arts, at least as far as the
Medici are concerned. The two greatest masters, in different
lines, of the first half of the century, Masaccio and Fra
Angelico, continued to adorn Florence with their works.
The former, at his death in 1443, left unfinished the Brancacci
chapel in San Pietro del Carmine, the high school of
all later works of the kind. Unluckily, the fresco has
perished in which he represented the consecration of the
church in 1422, with a group of remarkable men of the time:
Giovanni d’Averardo de’ Medici, Niccolò da Uzzano, Baccio
Valori, Lorenzo Ridolfi, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Masolino
da Panicale, and others. Fra Angelico decorated the
chapter-house, corridors, and cells of the convent of San
Marco with his wall-pictures, which represent religious art
in its loveliest bloom, a free modification of the principles of
Giotto’s school. He was busy here till Eugene IV. called
him to Rome, where he painted the two chapels in the
Vatican for this Pope and his successor, Nicolas V. He
died in 1455. His greatest pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, followed
his master from Rome to Orvieto, and in 1459 painted the
private chapel of the Medici, his most pleasing work. The
‘Adoration of the Angels’ is here represented amid a rich
landscape, with choirs of angels, numerous spectators, and
festive scenes, painted with a cheerful colouring that recalls
Gentile da Fabriano. Later, when painting in San Gemignano
and at Pisa, Gozzoli was still connected with the Medici,
and in his first fresco in the Campo Santo, the ‘Curse of
Ham,’ a group in the foreground represents the members of
the family as he had known them in earlier years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The realistic tendency exhibited by Masaccio grew more
prominent in Paolo Uccello, who was evidently influenced
by sculpture, especially by Donatello. In some of his most
important frescoes, those in Sta. Maria Novella, representing
the history of the Creation, and the figure of John Hawkwood
in Sta. Maria del Fiore,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the very colouring, grey upon
grey, aims at producing the effect of sculpture. This
painter’s study of perspective made him exaggerate that
branch of his art. The austerity of Andrea dal Castagno’s
style is not softened by the colouring. The repulsive expression
of his group of St. John and St. Francis in Sta.
Croce supports the legend of the murder of Domenico Veneziano,
which has adhered to Andrea’s name till our own day,
though he died four years before his supposed victim.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The
most important works he has left are the figures of sibyls
and of famous men, executed in a hall of the villa formerly
belonging to the Pandolfini at Legnaia, but now removed to
the National Museum at the Palace of the Podestà. The
characteristic figures, among whom are Nicola Acciaiuolo and
Pippo Spano, produce a great effect. Neither Andrea nor
Uccello seems to have been employed by the Medici, who
did, however, engage Domenico Veneziano, Andrea’s fellow-worker
on the lost frescoes in Sta. Maria Nuova, a painter
much influenced by Fra Angelico. The repeated occurrence
of the Medici’s patron saints, Cosmo and Damian, in pictures
of which the origin cannot be clearly traced, points to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the conclusion that they were commissions from the family
or their friends. But the painter most highly favoured by
Cosimo and his sons was Fra Filippo Lippi, whose manners
and conversation were as great a scandal to the Carmelite
order as Fra Angelico’s whole life was an ornament to that
of St. Dominic. Disorderly, loose in morals, always in difficulties
and need of money, he yet gained patrons by his undeniable
talent, which unites force and animation to Angelico’s
intensity of feeling. Lippi’s grouping and composition
is various, free, and rich, showing a realistic study of
nature. He worked a great deal for the Medici, who made
presents of his pictures to the Pope and King Alfonso, and
procured him commissions abroad. His greatest work, the
frescoes in the chapel in the choir of the Collegiate Church
of Prato, was finished for the Provost Carlo de’ Medici,
whose likeness may be seen in the representation of the
burial of St. Stephen. It was through Cosimo, who had
many connections in Umbria, that Fra Filippo went to
Spoleto, where he executed in the cathedral the scenes
from the history of the Madonna which were finished after
his death in 1469 by his assistant Fra Diamante.</p>

<p>Among the painters employed by Cosimo and his sons
were the two Peselli, Giuliano d’Arrigo, and his grandson
Pesellino; the former followed the artistic tendencies represented
by Giotto, the latter was an earnest disciple of the
realistic school. Much of the Medici furniture was painted
by them, according to a fashion of the time, continued
till the middle of the sixteenth century. Presses and coffers
(<i>cassoni</i>) were ornamented with compositions of small figures,
taken from history, sacred or profane, animals, hunting-scenes,
&amp;c. In the Florentine collections are many paintings
of this kind, even down to Andrea del Sarto and his
friends and pupils, the original destination of which is shown
by their form. They were not all Florentines who painted
for the Medici. A Veronese, Matteo de’ Pasti, wrote to
Piero in 1441, that he trusted to send him works such as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
had never before seen.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> He probably alluded to the convex
tablets (now in the Uffizi collection) representing scenes
from Petrarca’s triumphs, which were doubtless intended to
decorate a room. The various dealings of the Medici with
Flanders, from the time of Cosimo, contributed to draw attention
in Florence to the Van Eyck school of painting,
which influenced Italian art in the fifteenth century, particularly
in point of technicalities. It was through Tommaso
Portinari, director of the Medici bank at Bruges, that the
church of the hospital of Sta. Maria Nuova&mdash;an old foundation
of the family&mdash;obtained the most important work of the
Flemish school to be found in Tuscany. This was the
masterpiece of Hugo van der Goes, the ‘Adoration of the
Shepherds,’ containing portraits of the members of the
donor’s family.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The Flemish pictures mentioned by Vasari
as being in the possession of the Medici (one of them, a
portrait of Tommaso Portinari, is now in the Pitti Palace),
prove the interest awakened by these works, great as was
their difference in conception from Italian art.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine that other branches of artistic industry
were furthered by this artistically inclined family at
a period of such varied activity, and that their house kept
constantly filling with treasures of all kinds. For it was
the pride of the princes and rich citizens&mdash;and even of
such as had to deny themselves many of the comforts of life
in order to satisfy a noble passion&mdash;to surround themselves
with ancient and modern works, to decorate halls, staircases,
and courts with marbles and other antiquities; to collect
old coins and intaglios; to deck their rooms with statues and
sculptures by living artists, with handsome furniture, silver
plate, rich silken hangings and carpets.</p>

<p>Among the records of the Rinuccini family are notes of
the cost of goldsmiths’ work furnished by Finiguerra and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Pollaiuolo.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Cosimo’s love for these things was shared by
his brother Lorenzo and both his sons. An inventory of the
antique coins, cameos, gems, mosaic tablets; and enamels
preserved in the house in the Via Larga, mentions 100 gold
and 503 silver coins, a number of intaglios set as seals and
rings, Greek and Roman mosaic tablets, valuable vases,
precious stones to the value of more than thirty thousand
gold florins.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The silver plate here, as well as at the villas,
was not reckoned in. Mention has already been made of
the travelling antiquaries who carried about with them
manuscripts and objects of art, and were at once scholars
and colporteurs. But purchases were also made for the
Medici abroad. Antiquities came from Rome, Naples,
Viterbo, and other places. Donatello was accustomed to
restore injured antique marbles, a custom which was later
carried to extremes, and led to mischief. Worked carpets
(Arazzi) came from Flanders, where Bruges was the chief
emporium for works of art, though Antwerp fairs were often
visited.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> A letter of Carlo de’ Medici to his half-brother
Giovanni, written from Rome, apparently in the autumn of
1451,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> shows that Cardinal Barbo, afterwards Pope Paul II.,
was in competition with the Medici, and was not above a
little gentle compulsion: ‘I bought some time ago about
thirty silver medals from an assistant cf Pisanello, who is
lately dead. I know not how Monsignore di San Marco
heard of it, but, meeting me accidentally in the church of the
Santi Apostoli, he took me by the hand, and would not let
me go till he had got me to his house and taken all I had
about me&mdash;rings and coins to the value of about twenty
florins. There was no getting them back, and in the end I
have had to let him keep the things, after a vain appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Pope.’ The complaint is repeated in a letter of 1455.
As we shall see, however, such losses were more than made
up to the Medici at the death of Paul II.</p>

<p>Such were the relations of Cosimo and his sons to art-life
in Florence. The great movement had begun before they
took the helm of the state; but they exercised great and
beneficial influence on its development, and always set a
praiseworthy example to their fellow-citizens. In this respect
they thoroughly understood their time. The tone and
manner of their relations with artists is particularly attractive;
it was inspired by true refinement of feeling. Merchant
princes as they were, whose help was generally coveted, they
kept up a confidential intercourse with men of talent, as
among friends and equals. In the requests addressed to them
there is no tone of servility; the traditions of free citizenship
continued in all social relations. So it was also at a later
period, when Cosimo’s grandson had attained the position of
a ruling prince; Lorenzo’s bearing was the same, and contributed
not a little to his powerful influence over his fellow-men.
In many cases, as with Antonio Squarcialupi, the
musician and organ-builder, he merely continued a connection
begun by his father, uncle, and grandfather. Antonio,
who in his writings adopted the pseudonym Degli Organi,
belonged to an old family who had once been ‘Signori’
at Poggibonzi in the Elsa valley, and who on account of
their rank were long excluded from office. It was not till
1453 that Antonio became a member of one of the smaller
guilds, though before that time he was intimate with the
Medici household. After spending some time at Naples
with King Alfonso, in 1450, he wrote from Siena on November
26 to Giovanni de’ Medici at Volterra, as follows:<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
‘Dearest gossip, dutiful greeting and salutation! As you
doubtless know, it is now about a month since I returned
from Naples. Since then it has never ceased raining, or I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
should have come to see you. The bad weather has hindered
me not only from coming, but also from writing, as I kept
waiting for the sky to clear. Now, God be thanked for all
things. If I were to tell you about Naples, and the majesty
of the king and his court, there would be so much to say
that I must needs take all the scriveners in Rome into my
employ for five days. So for the present I will say nothing
about it, and will only tell you that Cardinal Sta. Maria sets
great store by his organ; wherein he is quite right, for truly
it deserves it. I promise you on your return the satisfaction
of hearing one which cannot fail to please you. It is destined
for Antonio di Migliorino, who I trust will not object to my
letting you see and hear it. Now I will trouble you no
further. Commend me above all to Madonna Contessina,
Messer Piero, and all the rest.’</p>

<p>In the spring of 1438, Domenico Veneziano wrote from
Perugia to Piero as follows:<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> ‘Noble and honoured sir,
greeting. I have to inform you that by God’s grace I am
in good health, and hope to see you well and happy. I have
made inquiries after you at various times, and never received
any news save through Manno Donati, who told me that
you were at Ferrara in very good health, which gave me
great pleasure. Had I known your place of abode sooner, I
would have written to you, both for my own satisfaction and
as it is fitting. My position is in truth far below yours, but
my hearty attachment to you and all yours gives me boldness
to write to you, to whom I owe so much.’ One-and-twenty
years later this same Piero, then at Careggi, was
thus addressed by Benozzo Gozzoli, who was painting the
chapel in the Medici house at Florence:<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> ‘My dearest
friend, I informed your Magnificence in a previous letter
that I am in need of forty florins, and begged you to advance
them to me; for now is the time to buy corn and many
other things that I want, whereby I shall save, and get rid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of a heavy load of care. I had resolved to ask nothing of
you till you had seen my work, but I now find myself compelled
to ask this favour. Therefore, be indulgent; God
knows I am endeavouring to please you. I also reminded
you to send to Venice for some ultramarine, for in the course
of this week one wall will be finished, and for the other I
shall need ultramarine. The brocades and other things can
then be finished as well as the figures, or even sooner. I
am working with all possible diligence. I have nothing
more to add save my salutations.’</p>

<p>These confidential relations between the Medici and the
artists did not prevent them from carefully settling minor
details when giving an order, such as the use of ultramarine
and gold, and still smaller matters. Even with regard to
the actual composition remarks were not spared, not merely
concerning the saints to be placed in the Madonna pictures
and other votive tablets, but also as to other figures and
accessories. Piero de’ Medici was not satisfied with some
angels that Benozzo had introduced in the chapel; the
painter defended them, but added that he could put a cloud
to cover them. Needless to say that all matters of business&mdash;prices,
instalments of payment and work, &amp;c.&mdash;were settled
with scrupulous exactness. This belonged to the character
of the time, and to the Florentine love of order and mercantile
habits; a characteristic which never fails, and remained
in the Medici nature even in Cosimo’s magnificent grandson.
Strict supervision was indeed necessary in the case of these
colossal undertakings. It was more especially needful with
a disorderly man like Filippo Lippi, who passed his whole life
in want of his own making; witness his letters to Piero and
Giovanni de’ Medici: ‘If there is a wretched monk in
Florence, it is I!’ His protectors pitied him and judged his
sins leniently, if we rightly understand the remark in one of
Giovanni’s letters, to the effect that they had a laugh over
Fra Filippo’s error. It refers presumably to the well-known
story of the elopement of Spinetta Buti from the convent at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Prato, where she was being educated; a story the details
of which, as in other instances, are inaccurately given by
Vasari.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The interest taken by the Medici in this painter
descended to Lorenzo. On his return from Rome he wanted
to have Fra Filippo’s mortal remains brought from Spoleto
to Florence, and when this was refused, he assisted Filippo’s
son in erecting a monument in Spoleto Cathedral.</p>

<p>It was in the time of Cosimo that the written history of
art began its first feeble efforts. Its forerunner was Cennino
Cennini of Colle in the Elsa valley, a pupil of Angelo Gaddi
apparently at Padua, where he was in the service of Francesco
da Carrara. Towards the end of the fourteenth century
he wrote a book on painting, which is of great value
for the study of artistic practice before the victory of oil-painting
over tempera, as it is also for the history of modelling,
casting, plaster-work, gilding, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> This book treats
merely of technicalities; but in Lorenzo Ghiberti’s commentaries
an unfinished treatise on architecture and the proportion
of figures is combined with notices of ancient art
and also of modern, from its re-awakening in the second
half of the thirteenth century down to the writer’s own time
and works.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The latter portion is the principal source
whence Giorgio Vasari drew his knowledge of past times.
Ghiberti’s contemporary Filarete has given many notices,
valuable for the history of art, referring to Medicean times,
in his treatise on architecture, which he dedicated&mdash;in styles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
differing according to the persons and circumstances, to
two patrons, Piero de’ Medici and Francesco Sforza, in 1460.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
These notices, as well as technical remarks, were also made
use of by Vasari, whose judgment on Filarete’s confused
book is just, though rather severely expressed.</p>

<p class="pch">BUILDING IN THE DAYS OF LORENZO DE’ MEDICI.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Architecture</span> was always a subject of great interest to
Lorenzo de’ Medici; he possessed an unusual knowledge of
the art.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> It was he who made the plan for the façade of
Sta. Maria del Fiore, which was executed in wood by Jacopo
Sansovino and painted in chiaroscuro by Andrea del Sarto
more than twenty years after the designer’s death, when his
son, Pope Leo X., made his public entry into Florence.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
We shall see what share he took in the project for the completion
of this façade. He was intimate with several of the
chief architects of the time. A letter, written to him from
Rome by Alberti,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> unluckily not on the subject of art but about
a proposed exchange of property, shows on what good terms
they were: ‘I am glad that thou dost address me in confidence
worthy of our old friendship; and as I am conscious
of my obligations, I am ready to do for thee and at thy
desire anything that can be agreeable to one who loves thee.
If what thou askest of me were not founded on reason, thou
wouldest neither have consented to act as mediator thyself,
nor have sought out a third party to do so.’ The brothers
Da Majano and Sangallo enjoyed his interest and assistance
both in and outside of Florence, where a great deal of building
was carried on. Yet he built nothing more himself than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a convent and a villa. Of the convent not a trace is left,
and the façades of the cathedral and of the church of the
Santo Spirito&mdash;in which he was so much interested&mdash;still
await completion, as does that of San Lorenzo, though
Pope Leo X. made preparations for the immediate execution
of the works. The finest building of Lorenzo’s time in
Florence was erected, not for him but for a family which,
although connected with his, was destined to maintain a
long struggle with it&mdash;namely, the Strozzi.</p>

<p>Considering how intimate Lorenzo was with the brothers
Da Majano, it seems strange that he employed them so little.
There is no authentic record of Giuliano having been employed
in Florence except as a worker in wood. He was
engaged on the choir-stalls in Sta. Maria del Fiore in 1471
and the following years, and in the audience-chamber of the
palace of the Signoria (finished ten years later), where his
younger brother Benedetto executed the marble doors, and
where he was associated with Francesco di Giovanni, called
Francione, master of Baccio Pontelli, who did a great deal
of work at Rome and Urbino.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Giuliano’s works in Rome,
where, according to Vasari, he built&mdash;under Paul III.&mdash;the
palace of San Marco and a galleried court, now no longer in
existence, are buried in impenetrable obscurity. It is certain
that he was there in the time of Sixtus IV., and also that
he began the stalls in the choir of Perugia Cathedral, which
were finished in 1491 by Domenico del Tasso, one of the
Florentine family of wood-workers and architects.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> It is
needless to repeat how the calling and labours of architect
and wood-worker (<i>magistri lignaminum</i>, <i>legnaiuoli</i>) merged
one into the other, even in the next century, like those of
sculptor and goldsmith. In his latter years Giuliano was
more abroad than at home. In 1478 he was at Recanati, in
the States of the Church, building a palace for Antonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Giacomo Venier, Cardinal of Cuença, who appealed to
Lorenzo that he might urge the dilatory artist to go on with
his work:<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> ‘As the said Master Giuliano is a most devoted
servant of your Magnificence and eulogist of your excellent
qualities, and apparently cannot be moved unless stirred up
by you, we beg you to address him on the subject, and to
see that he goes to Recanati at the appointed time to finish
what he has begun.’ In the spring of 1481 Giuliano was
passing through Urbino, where the palace of Federigo of
Montefeltro made such an impression on him that he induced
Lorenzo to ask the duke for a drawing of it. This the duke
had executed by Baccio Pontelli, who continued the beautiful
work of Luciano Lauranna. ‘My lord the duke,’ wrote
Pontelli to Lorenzo,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> ‘answered very graciously that I was
to make the drawing, but that he would prefer sending your
Magnificence the house itself, that you might rule in it as in
your own.’ It was doubtless Lorenzo’s doing that Giuliano
was summoned to Naples. This must, therefore, have happened
after the reconciliation in 1480. Notwithstanding
the many commissions he received there&mdash;for King Ferrante
and his eldest son were both much given to building, and
after the expulsion of the Turks from Otranto the kingdom
enjoyed a few years’ peace&mdash;there is no need to suppose that
he took up his abode there permanently, for artists were
generally given to wandering. The famous triumphal arch of
King Alfonso in Castelnuovo&mdash;not finished till the sixteenth
century&mdash;is probably in no part his work; but certainly to him
may be attributed the Porta Capuana, excellent in point of
architecture but disfigured by modern additions.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Giuliano
died at Naples in the autumn of 1490, and Lorenzo’s expressions
concerning his loss, in a letter to the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Calabria,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> show how highly he esteemed him: ‘Your Excellency’s
letter informs me of the death of Giuliano da Majano,
which causes me sincere regret, both on account of our
intimacy and because he was engaged in your Excellency’s
service, and his death will leave many a work unfinished.
As you contemplate continuing these, I hear that you want
me to procure you another architect, on which subject Paol’
Antonio Soderini writes to me in detail. It will give me
pleasure if your Excellency will command my services and
be satisfied with my arrangements, as was the case with
Giuliano; at whose death I have at least the satisfaction
that you have been pleased with the work of one who entered
your service on my recommendation.’</p>

<p>Giuliano’s brother Benedetto, ten years his junior, was
not employed as an architect by Lorenzo. His share&mdash;as
wood-carver&mdash;in the works at the palace of the Signoria has
been already referred to. But his masterpiece was a work
of architecture executed in the last years of Lorenzo’s life,
and&mdash;if we except the Pitti Palace, which stands alone&mdash;the
most perfect specimen of palatial architecture that Florence
has to show. The story of the building begun by Filippo
Strozzi the elder in 1489 makes a curious study of manners
and an interesting chapter in the history of art. When
Cosimo de’ Medici contemplated building himself a house,
he was afraid of rousing disapproval by too much splendour;
more than half a century later another rich citizen felt the
same anxiety. He saw the commonwealth and city in
altered circumstances, and had before his eyes the warning
example of Luca Pitti. Lorenzo Strozzi, who wrote a life of
his father, tells of this grand undertaking:<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> ‘When Filippo
had made due provision for his descendants&mdash;as he thought
more of fame than of money, was fond of building, and intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in the art&mdash;he decided, as the surest way of handing
down his name to posterity, to erect such a building as
should make a name for him and his throughout Italy and
beyond it. He found, however, one great hindrance in the
way. The man who was at the head of the Government
might take it into his head that the reputation of another
would put his own into the shade, and Filippo was in great
dread of exciting envy. So he had it rumoured about the
city that his children were so numerous and his house so
small that, now they were grown up, he must provide an
abode for them, which could be better done in his lifetime
than after his death. Then he began, with all sorts of circumlocutions,
to talk&mdash;first to master-masons and then to
architects&mdash;on the necessity of building a new house. At
times he spoke as though he would begin soon; then made
a show of being still undecided and unwilling to spend in a
hurry the fruits of many years’ labour. Thus artfully did he
conceal the object he had in view in order to attain it better.
He used to repeat, a comfortable citizen-like house was
enough for him, good but not grand. Now the masons and
architects, after their kind, kept enlarging upon his plans,
which was just what pleased Filippo, though he pretended
to the contrary, and declared that they drove him to what
he was neither willing nor able to do.</p>

<p>Now it happened that he who then governed the destinies
of the city desired to see it embellished in every way;
his opinion being that if he was responsible for good and
evil, so would beauty or ugliness be laid to his account.
Deeming that so large and costly an undertaking would be
difficult to estimate and superintend, and might (as often
happens with merchants) either destroy the originator’s
credit or ruin him altogether, he began to meddle in the
matter, and asked to see the plans. When he had examined
them, he suggested divers embellishments, and advised the
use of <i>opus rusticum</i>. But the more Filippo was encouraged
the more he pretended to draw back. He declared he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
on no account have <i>opus rusticum</i>, as it was unsuitable to
the condition of a citizen, and would entail heavy expense.
He was building, he said, with a view to his own comfort, and
not for pomp; and thought of making shops on the ground
floor, to produce an income for his sons. To this everybody
objected, pointing out how ugly and inconvenient it
would be. Still Filippo continued his remonstrances, and
said complainingly to his friends that he had begun an undertaking
which he only hoped he might bring to a successful
end; he wished he had never spoken of it, rather than
have got into such a labyrinth. The more he pretended to
be afraid of the cost, to conceal the greatness of his intentions
and the extent of his wealth, the more he was urged
and encouraged to the building. Thus by adroitness and
caution, he managed what, had he conducted himself otherwise,
would either have been forbidden or have brought him
under no little suspicion.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to gain space for the <i>casa
grande</i>. And space was limited. The Strozzi palace lies at
the west end of the old town, in a quarter now, perhaps, the
liveliest in the city, and doubtless animated even at that time,
being close to the old market and to the square named after
the church of Sta. Trinità, whence may be seen the bridge
of the same name. Several distinguished families dwelt, and
some still dwell, in the immediate neighbourhood: the
Buondelmonti, Altoviti, Gianfigliazzi, Bartolini, Alamanni,
Viviani, Tornabuoni, Vacchietti, Antinori, and others. According
to the original plan, the building was to stand free,
with a square and garden on the south, extending as far as
the Via Portarossa, where stand the houses of the Davanzati
and Torrigiani. But the plan was imperfectly executed. A
tolerably large square is on the eastern side, but on the
south only a narrow space, now bridged over, divides the
palace from neighbouring buildings; on the west the street
(Via de’ Legnaiuoli) is of moderate width, and on the north
it is only since the front of the Tornabuoni house was rebuilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a few years ago (see p. 125), that sufficient space and light
has been gained to get a view of the noble edifice, which on
this side was formerly quite hidden.</p>

<p>On August (July?) 16, 1489, Filippo Strozzi laid his
foundation-stone. His memoirs contain a description of the
important proceeding, characteristic of the habits of the
time. ‘At the moment when the sun came up over the
mountains, I laid the first stone of the foundations, in the
name of God, as a good beginning for myself, my successors,
and all who may have a share in the building. I caused a
mass of the Holy Ghost to be sung at the same hour by the
brethren of San Marco, another by the nuns of Murate, a
third in my church, Sta. Maria di Lecceto, and a fourth by
the monks there (who are under some obligation to me),
with a prayer for a blessed beginning to the work. The
time for laying the foundation-stone was fixed by a horoscope
by Messer Benedetto Biliotti, Maestro Niccolò, and
Messer Antonio Benevieni, doctors; also Bishop Pagagnotti
and Messer Marsilio (Ficino), who all confirmed it as lucky.
I sent twenty lire to the brethren of San Marco, to be distributed
in alms as they thought good, and as many to
Murate. I spent ten lire in smaller alms. To Benedetto
Biliotti I gave four ells of black damask, costing twenty lire.
I had to breakfast Maestro Jacopo the master-mason,
Maestro Andrea the founder, Filippo Buondelmonti, Marcuccio
Strozzi, Pietro Parenti, Simone Ridolfi, Donato Bonsi,
Ser Agnolo, Lorenzo Fiorini, and other of my friends.’</p>

<p>The ground floor was not yet half built when Filippo
died, on May 14, 1491. After him, the house was the abode
of fortune and greatness; but how many storms burst over
it in the days of his youngest son and of his grandchildren!</p>

<p>The Strozzi Palace is a great square building, nearly a
hundred feet high, and a hundred and twenty feet wide; it
displays rustic work in its greatest perfection, and, notwithstanding
the severity and simplicity of its construction, is
more attractive than any other building of this style. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
stories, of nearly equal elevation, are divided by strongly
defined string-courses, and are composed of great blocks of
ashlar (now blackened by nearly four centuries) of unequal
length, but in even horizontal lines&mdash;<i>opus rusticum</i> throughout,
but more evenly hewn than in the houses of the Medici
and the Pitti, and other buildings. The ground floor has a
grand arched doorway on each of the three façades, and
small square windows at a considerable height above the
stone parapet that runs round the whole. The two upper
stories have arched windows divided by small marble columns,
with the crescent of the family arms in the panels, and surmounted,
like the doors, with upright blocks of ashlar. The
handsome but half-finished cornice and the courtyard, both
by Simone del Pollaiuolo called Cronaca, and the famous
iron lanterns, belong to a period later than that now under
consideration. The founder had thought he could complete
the building out of his income, without touching his capital;
but, owing to untoward circumstances and dissensions among
the sons, the work was not brought to its present state of
relative completeness till forty-two years after Filippo’s death.</p>

<p>In Lorenzo’s letter to the Duke of Calabria, after the
death of Giuliano da Majano, he states that he was endeavouring
to replace the lost one. ‘On looking about among
the master-builders here, I find no one who, in my opinion,
can be compared with Giuliano. I have, therefore, written
to Mantua, to a Florentine there, whose capabilities and
practice in building ought, I think, to qualify him for the
work to be done. If this should come to nothing, and we
can make no better choice, we shall be obliged to choose the
least bad one possible (<i>il manco reo che sarà possibile</i>) in this
place.’<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> These words sound strange from Lorenzo, when
Benedetto da Majano and Giuliano da Sangallo were both
in Florence. The most probable explanation is that present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
engagements prevented them from leaving the city, and
therefore, Lorenzo’s choice fell on Luca Fancelli, who holds
a subordinate place in the history of art. Benedetto must
have been already known at Naples, and Lorenzo himself
had, in 1488, sent to King Ferrante the plan of a palace, by
Sangallo,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> who, in consequence, went to Naples. Giuliano,
son of Francesco Giamberti, had been from his childhood
known to the Medici family, to whom in Cosimo’s and
Piero’s days his father furnished woodwork. He himself,
instructed by his father and Francione, acquired great skill
in this art, did some work in Sta. Maria del Fiore, in the
palace of the Signoria, and at Pisa, and even in later years
continued to style himself <i>Legnaiuolo</i>. The Giamberti
family must have been intimately connected with the Medici,
for after the death of Giuliano de’ Medici his little son
Giulio was taken care of in their house in Borgo Pinti,
where the Panciatichi-Ximenes palace now stands. Giuliano
Giamberti afterwards followed two branches of architecture,
fortification and palace-building, with great success. In his
latter years he was engaged on Sta. Maria del Fiore and St.
Peter’s at Rome.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1472, Giuliano, then twenty-nine, was
at Rome, working for Sixtus IV.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> What he actually did
there, where so many Tuscans were employed, is unknown.
That he made long and frequent sojourns there is proved by
his excellent studies of antique buildings, that have been so
useful to later investigators, and by his intimate connection
with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere. The war of 1478
called him home, where he served as an engineer in defending
various places. The restoration of peace enabled him to
resume his works at Rome; one of which, the castle of
Ostia, begun probably for the above-named cardinal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
finished in 1486, marks an important step in military architecture,
while its picturesque beauty indicates the eye of a
true artist.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Long before this castle was finished, Giuliano
must have begun at home the building which raised him
highest in the esteem of Lorenzo de’ Medici&mdash;the villa at
Poggio a Cajano. Francione and others had submitted
plans; Lorenzo chose that of Giuliano. The situation is
favourable, on a hill of no great elevation, but with a clear
view on three sides. The house is reached by a broad flight
of steps, and is of the regular Tuscan type, which continued
to later times. The portico before the hall, with its gable
decorated with a frieze in Terra della Robbia, displays a tendency
to the antique. The great hall has a barrel-vault,
the dimensions of which gave rise to a doubt as to the possibility
of its execution.</p>

<p>At the time when Giuliano is supposed to have gone to
Naples, a great work begun by him in his native city can
scarcely have been ready for habitation. This was the convent
of the Augustinian Friars in front of the Porta San
Gallo, the immediate occasion of which was Lorenzo’s liking
for the preacher Fra Mariano of Genazzano. The work
was important enough to give the artist a new name, under
which the whole family became famous. According to Vasari,
it was Lorenzo who first used the appellation, and on
Giuliano’s playful remark that he was taking a backward
step in abandoning his old family name, Lorenzo replied
that it was better to make a name by one’s own merits than
to inherit one.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Only a part of the huge building was completed,
and this was totally destroyed in 1529. To Lorenzo
is attributed the idea of rebuilding the castle on the Poggio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Imperiale near Pozzibonzi, the importance of which had
been but too clearly shown in the wars of 1478-79, and he
obtained the commission for Giuliano. The work began in
1488, was afterwards directed by Giuliano’s younger brother,
but finally sank into as complete ruin as the works of Henry
of Luxemburg on the same spot. Nothing is known of
what Sangallo did in Milan, whither he is believed to have
gone on Lorenzo’s recommendation, with the plan of a palace,
for Lodovico il Moro, and where he met Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<p>His great patron was no longer living when he began,
for Giuliano Gondi, on the Piazza San Firenze, the palace
which, though unfinished, still produces a pleasing effect
with its fine proportions, its artistic arrangement of rustic
work on the first and second stories, and its elegant arcade.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The court of the convent of Sta. Maria Maddalena de’ Pazzi
(Cestello), in the Via de’ Pinti, is one of Giuliano’s earlier
works, not wanting in character or grace. Nothing is known
of independent works by Antonio, Giuliano’s brother and
frequent assistant, during Lorenzo’s lifetime. His time of
activity in Tuscany and Rome, both as a military builder,
and as an architect of churches and palaces, began under
Alexander VI. and lasted till only a degenerate scion was
left of the race of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The Aretine
art-historian rightly says that these two brothers left architecture
as an inheritance to their family. It was they who
mainly contributed to keep up in Tuscany a tradition which
was never quite false to the Quattrocento, even when the
Renaissance had been overgrown with a certain grotesqueness.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was concerned in two great works, neither of
which came to perfection. The building and decoration of
the façade of Sta. Maria del Fiore went on till about the
middle of the fifteenth century. Donatello and his school
contributed to it the marble facings and statues which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
carried up to the rose-windows over the side doors.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The
completion of the work was all the more to be desired as the
gilt cross had gleamed above the lantern of the dome since
May 30, 1472. On February 12, 1490, the following decree
was issued by the consuls of the wool-merchants’ guild:<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
‘Forasmuch as of late several of the chief citizens have repeatedly
called to mind what a great dishonour it is to this
city that the front of the cathedral church should remain in
its present condition, to wit, unfinished, and also that the
parts already executed in nowise correspond to the rules of
architecture, and are bad in many ways, and that it would
be highly praiseworthy to come to some conclusion on the
matter, the said consuls have resolved and given authority
to the present and future master-builders of the church to
regulate expenditure and arrange everything that shall seem
to them good and profitable for the said purpose now and
hereafter.’ This decree shows that in the minds of those
concerned the fate of the existing portions of the façade was
as much decided as ninety-six years later, when they were
destroyed after very brief deliberation.</p>

<p>On January 5, 1491, a commission met, under the presidency
of the two master-builders Maso degli Albizzi and
Tommaso Minerbetti, to pass judgment on the numerous
models and designs (<i>modelli et designi undique habiti et
collecti</i>). Many who were not personally present had sent in
plans: Benedetto da Majano, Francesco di Giorgio, Filippino
Lippi, Andrea Verrocchio, Antonio Pollaiuolo. There
were two designs by Giuliano da Majano, then lately dead.
No less than twenty-nine artists had come forward, among
whom were Cronaca, Benedetto da Majano, Francione,
Lorenzo di Credi, Domenico Ghirlandajo, Pietro Perugino,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Andrea Contucci of Montesansovino, Andrea della Robbia,
Sandro Botticelli, Alesso Baldovinetti, and others who,
except in this case, are known only as goldsmiths or painters.
Lorenzo de’ Medici himself had sent in a design. The
meeting was held in the portico and the loggia of the office
of works (<i>Opera</i>), the arches of which&mdash;now blocked up and
containing a fine marble bust of the first grand duke on the
façade&mdash;may be seen behind the choir of the cathedral. The
models and designs having been examined, were reported on
by Tommaso Minerbetti, whereupon Carlo Benci&mdash;a canon
and one of the competitors&mdash;being asked his opinion, rose
and said that he held it advisable to take the opinion of
Lorenzo de’ Medici, a man so versed in architecture that if
they followed him they would be the least likely to fall into
error. Bartolommeo Scala recommended that a decision
should be adjourned to give opportunity for further deliberation.
Others took the same view, but thought it better to
wait no longer than was absolutely needful. Then Lorenzo
de’ Medici rose, and said: ‘All who had sent in models or
designs were deserving of praise; but as the work in question
was one of lasting importance, long and grave deliberation
was needful, and it was advisable to postpone a decision in
order to consider the matter further.’ Pietro Machiavelli
and Antonio Manetti, architects, supported him, the rest
were silent. Sixteen months later he who had started the
whole affair lay in his grave. Then came times when
Florence had other things to think of than the façade of her
cathedral. For the latter, however, it was well that the rebuilding
was not begun at that time, for Giuliano da Majano
and Giuliano da San Gallo would have been just as incapable
of producing work corresponding with the main character of
the building, as were Buontalenti or Dosio under the
Grand Duke Ferdinand I., or Baccio del Bianco&mdash;a decorative
painter rather than an architect&mdash;of whose façade the
foundation-stone was actually laid in 1636. The old unfinished
façade might not correspond with the mighty pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that had developed under the hands of so many architects,
but the new one would have disfigured it for ever.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The church of the Santo Spirito, too, remained unfinished.
Great damage had been done by a fire on March 22, 1471,
and three months after contributions were voted out of the
taxes for the restoration,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> as had been done before. In consideration
of this the municipality made it a condition that
the escutcheon of the lilies and the cross should be placed
beside those of the guilds. There was some difference about
the doors, as appears from a decree of the master-builders in
1486, and from a letter of Giuliano da Sangallo to Lorenzo,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
which also shows the want of agreement between the former
and Giuliano da Majano. Six architects were to deliberate
on the matter, and Majano seems to have carried the day, to
the disgust of Sangallo, who expresses a hope that Lorenzo
on his return will not allow such a fine building to be spoiled.
Further information is wanting. It is to be regretted that
the exterior was not finished then, while the traditions of
Brunelleschi’s time were still in a great measure alive. On
the other hand, a great deal was done in the interior of the
choir of Sta. Maria del Fiore. In the palace of the Signoria
also much work was accomplished in the first and second
stories&mdash;especially the latter&mdash;in the audience chamber, and
neighbouring apartments. It cannot be doubted that
Lorenzo had a share in all this. The Sala dell’Orologia in
the palace took its name from the curious clock made by
Lorenzo della Volpaia for the Medici house, and afterwards
placed in this hall, whence it has strayed to the Museum of
Natural History. It is a handsome piece of work, after the
pattern of those made in the fourteenth century by the
Paduan Giovanni Dondi (degli Orologi), showing the courses
of the planets, the signs of the zodiacal and celestial phenomena,
and it brought great fame to its maker, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
appointed clockmaker to the city in 1500.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Volpaia had a
rival in one Dionisio da Viterbo, who, in June, 1477, was recommended
by the rich Sienese banker Ambrogio Spannocchi
to Lorenzo de’ Medici, to whom he wished to show
an ornamental clock with numerous figures that moved at
the same time.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The great number of architects in Lorenzo’s latter years
shows how actively building was carried on. The works
executed at that time by Simone del Pollaiuolo Cronaca
cannot be chronologically arranged. But when it is considered
that at Lorenzo’s death this talented man was thirty-five
years old, and was soon after fully engaged on public
works, it is easy to see that he must long have been in active
occupation.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The Servite convent of the Annunziata, the
interior of which was his work, has been entirely altered.
On the foremost slope of the hill of San Miniato he built
the Franciscan church, for which a rich citizen&mdash;Castello
Quaratesi&mdash;had left to the guild of Calimala a large sum in
1449.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> This man had intended to decorate Sta. Croce with
a suitable façade, but the scheme came to nothing because
he was refused permission to place his coat of arms on the
building. The church of San Francesco recalls the abbey of
Fiesole. Tradition relates that Michel Angelo admired the
simple grace of this church (<i>La bella villanella</i>), in whose
immediate neighbourhood he spent some time when in difficulties.
The sacristy of Sto. Spirito, a very elegant octagon,
was not finished till later; Cronaca’s cupola fell in when the
scaffolding was taken away.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> A great deal of building went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on in the immediate neighbourhood of the city. The church
of Montoliveto, which, from its cypress-crowned hill on the
left bank of the river, overlooks city and country, was finished
in 1472. Older conventual buildings were enlarged and
churches beautified. This was the case above all with the
before-mentioned Dominican nunnery of Annalena in the
quarter of Oltrarno, and the monastery of the Jesuates at
San Giusto, whose church contained numerous works of art.
The building of the façade of Sta. Croce was contemplated
in 1476, as is proved by a decree of the municipality, which
assigned for the purpose a sum to be collected from backward
taxpayers. It was reserved for our own times to witness
the execution of the project, after a sketch said to be by
Cronaca. The court in front of the Servites’ church, and
the colonnade on the square in front of the church, opposite
the Foundling Hospital and imitating its portico, are both
attributed to Antonio da Sangallo, and, if not begun in
Lorenzo’s lifetime, must at all events have been built soon
after his death.</p>

<p>Lorenzo had obtained from Innocent VIII. leave to use
the convent gardens&mdash;where they were larger than necessary&mdash;for
the construction of new streets and squares, and the
widening of old ones. Space there was in plenty, for after
all the building in the sixteenth century the great number
of convents was further increased in the days of the later
Medici by many new ones on a large scale. One of the new
streets of that time&mdash;behind the Servites’ church&mdash;bears the
name of Via Laura, after Lorenzo. Quieter times and increase
of riches naturally strengthened the taste for building,
and fine houses with their extensive courts and gardens
called for adornment with antiquities and works of art.
The palace, the gardens, the villas of the Medici were the
richest; but they were not without rivals. The Strozzi,
Acciaiuoli, Soderini, Capponi, Tornabuoni, Sassetti, Benci,
Ricci, Valori, Alessandri, Pucci, Rucellai, Pandolfini, and
many others ordered works of painting and sculpture for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
their homes and villas as well as for their chapels in the
city churches. The house of the Martelli, the garden of the
Pazzi, the villa of the Valori at Majano, and many others,
were full of antique statues. In the palace of Niccolò da
Uzzano might be seen the antique porphyry lion which
Lorenzo greatly admired,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and which still adorns the staircase
of the house. Artists, too, had many fine things. In
the house of the Ghiberti, for example, was a precious
sculptured marble vase which the famous artist Lorenzo
Ghiberti was said to have received from Greece.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">SCULPTURE AND PAINTING.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> first man to whom Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici
gave a commission for a great piece of sculpture, after they
became independent, was Andrea del Verrocchio. He was a
disciple of Donatello, and had worked with the master in
San Lorenzo. This was of itself a recommendation to the
Medici, who found him also employed by their relatives, the
Tornabuoni. Vasari rightly observes that a certain severity
is even more prominent in his works than in those of his
master, because he lacked the creative versatility of the
latter and tried to supply by study what Nature had denied
him. In bronze-casting he displays a delicacy which recalls
the goldsmith. The monument to Piero and Giovanni de’
Medici was finished in 1472. Like Donatello, Verrocchio
restored damaged antique sculptures for the Medici house
and garden, and executed for Lorenzo some bronze busts
which were sent to Matthias Corvinus. For the palace of
the Signoria he furnished a bronze statue of David, now in
the Podestà Museum, not very remarkable either in conception
or execution. His shortcomings, however, are amply
atoned for by the charming bronze group over the fountain
in the courtyard, representing a boy, half-fighting, half-playing
with a dolphin, full of easy grace that seems almost
above this artist. It was a commission from Lorenzo, and
intended for the fountain in the court at Careggi, but placed
in its present position by Duke Cosimo. Verrocchio’s capabilities
in more serious work were shown in Florence by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
group of our Lord and the apostle St. Thomas, which in
1483 received the most prominent place in front of the
church of Or San Michele&mdash;and in Venice, by his equestrian
statue of Colleone. Though the former, with its broken
and angular drapery&mdash;recalling the Umbrian school&mdash;does
not exactly conform to the rules of plastic art, it is penetrated
with a depth of feeling that renders it highly attractive;
and in the latter the defiant self-conscious bearing of the
old <i>condottiere</i> brings his position and character vividly
before the eye. Among Andrea’s marble works is a relievo,
very naturalistic, representing the death (in her confinement,
September 24, 1477) of Francesca Pitti, wife of Giovanni
Tornabuoni; it was intended for her tomb, and is now to be
seen in the palace of the Podestà.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Equally intimate with the Medici, if not more so, was
Antonio del Pollaiuolo, whose family connections linked him
to the school of Ghiberti. In his sculptures the goldsmith
is more closely discernible than in those of Verrocchio.
They both, while painting and sculpturing, continued to
work as goldsmiths, and Pollaiuolo was regarded in his
native city as the first master of this branch. ‘A man
unique in his art,’ wrote the Signoria, after his death, to the
ambassador in Rome, ‘well deserving that we, who are wont
to value praiseworthy qualities of whatever nature, should
honour his memory by supporting his heirs.’<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Lorenzo’s
high esteem for him is shown by passages in his letters to
Giovanni Lanfredini. The silver helmet presented in 1472
to the conqueror of Volterra was by Pollaiuolo; so was also
the oft-copied medal representing the criminal attempt of
the Pazzi, more valuable in a historical than in an artistic
point of view. No great works of sculpture by him are
known in Florence, the labour of his latter years being chiefly
devoted to Rome, where his masterpiece is the tomb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Pope Sixtus IV. in the chapel of the Holy Sacrament in
St. Peter’s, and where he died in 1498.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>As Verocchio and Pollaiuolo passed from goldsmith’s
work to sculpture, without abandoning altogether their
original occupation, so Benedetto da Majano rose from
artistic cabinet-work to sculpture and architecture. The
monument to Giotto in Sta. Maria del Fiore&mdash;a marble bust
in a richly ornamented circular frame&mdash;was, according to the
inscription, erected by the citizens in 1490.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The bust of
Antonio Squarcialupi, in the same church, is only ascribed to
Benedetto by a later tradition, which the merit of the work
by no means justifies.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The erection of both monuments
was, doubtless, due to Lorenzo. Benedetto’s greatest work
was a pulpit, executed for a Florentine citizen&mdash;Pietro Mellini&mdash;of
whom he also made, in 1474, a most natural and
expressive marble bust, which he signed with his name. The
pulpit is decorated with reliefs, representing scenes in the
history of St. Francis of Assisi&mdash;the richest and finest work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of the kind since that of the Pisani. In imitation of
Ghiberti, the reliefs are freely handled; landscapes and
backgrounds in perspective are introduced, but with a careful
subordination of the pictorial elements which afterwards
became too prominent.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> In Sta. Maria Novella is Benedetto’s
monument to Filippo Strozzi. The artist who built the
palace, of which the owner lived to see only the beginning,
also erected in his beautiful family chapel this mausoleum,
which was begun before his death.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Above the black marble
sarcophagus, in the middle of a panel under an arch delicately
carved in arabesques, is a large medallion of the
Virgin and Child, in white marble, surrounded by a rich
garland of flowers and foliage; at the sides are four angels
in adoration. The charm of expression and delicacy of
treatment recall Antonio Rossellino and Desiderio da Settignano.
Filippo’s bust, preserved by his descendants in the
Strozzi Palace, shows the marked, expressive features of the
energetic man. Benedetto’s capabilities in decorative sculpture
are displayed in the marble doors of the audience-chamber
in the palace of the Signoria, where he worked, as
has been mentioned, with his brother. Time and ignorance
have not spared this fine work, and the statuette of the
youthful Baptist, which once adorned it, is now in the
Uffizi collection.</p>

<p>The two finest works of Mino da Fiesole which adorn
the Benedictine Abbey-Church, were executed about 1470;
one represents the artist’s own time, the other the earlier
days of Florence. They are the monuments of Bernardo
Giugni, and of the Marquis Hugo. The former, and his
services to the State have been already mentioned. The
figure of an elderly man, in his long robe, with his hands
crossed on his breast, lies on the sarcophagus; between
Ionian pilasters is a semi-circular niche, in which is a figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of Justice in relief, and in the lunette is a medallion profile
of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The other monument, finished in 1481, is
richer, but very like the first in general arrangement. It is
a token of gratitude from the monks to their founder&mdash;the
half-mythical Marquis who, in Emperor Otto’s days, is said
to have come from the neighbourhood of the Elbe and the
Havel&mdash;the ‘great Baron’ of the ‘Divine Comedy,’ whose
arms are quartered on the armorial bearings of the chief
Florentine families.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> His effigies rest on a low couch on the
top of the sarcophagus, two genii support shields at his head
and feet; there is a group in relief, representing Charity,
and in the lunette a medallion of the Virgin and Child. As
in all Mino’s sculpture, careful workmanship is manifest in
the accessories. This attention to detail and richness of
ornamentation long remained a characteristic of the Florentines,
who carried it to Rome and Naples. In the early
decades of the following century, when the revolution in
monumental style, introduced chiefly by Michel Angelo, was
beginning to make its way, and ornamentation was compelled
to take refuge in painting, admirable works in the old
manner were raised in Florence. Such were the tombs of
Oddo Altoviti, and Pier Soderini, both by Benedetto da
Rovezzano; also the monument to Cardinal Luigi de’ Rossi,
cousin of Leo X., said to be by Raffaello da Montelupo.
With regard to ornamentation, a distinct position is held by
two monuments, companions to each other, which tradition
ascribes to Giuliano da Sangallo&mdash;those of Francesco Sassetti
and his wife, in their family chapel in Sta. Trinità.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> They
consist of black marble sarcophagi, decorated with rams’
heads, and standing beneath an arch adorned with antique
arabesques and medallions, and a frieze, in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which are medallion heads of the husband and wife, surrounded
by small figures representing ceremonies of heathen
worship. They are clearly the work of an artist well acquainted
with classical antiquity; who, in this case, has
certainly made rather a strange use of his studies. That
Giuliano da Sangallo was expert in the use of the chisel and
thoroughly understood the working of the Fiesolian stone,
employed in this monument, is shown by his famous mantelpiece
in the Gondi Palace, which served as a model for that
by Benedetto da Rovezzano in the Casa Rosselli del Turco,
near Sant’Apostolo.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Tuscan sculptors of ornamental work,
particularly those from Fiesole, Settignano, Rovezzano, and
the neighbourhood, found occupation all over Italy, like the
architects and sculptors from the Lake of Como, the <i>maestri
Comacini</i>, in the Middle Ages. In our own days the Tuscans
still show great ability in working both marble and <i>macigno</i>
(the greyish stone of the neighbourhood of Florence) in
which they produce objects of beautifully delicate workmanship.</p>

<p>Other arts at this time rose to a highly flourishing condition.
The connection between architecture and cabinet-making,
and that between sculpture and goldsmith’s work,
have been repeatedly referred to. The architect and cabinet-maker
were often one, down to the middle of the following
century, when the Del Tasso family continued their double
occupation. But artistic cabinet-work was also connected
with sculpture and painting, as may be seen by the rich
choir-stalls of many churches; the ceilings and other woodwork
of the palaces, with their fine reliefs, elegant panelling,
and wood-mosaic (<i>tarsia</i>), much used to represent perspective
as well as to imitate flowers and foliage. Many of the
artists mentioned furnished work of this kind to the
cathedral of Sta. Maria del Fiore, and to the palace of the
Signoria. The goldsmith’s art was in its glory, followed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it was by great sculptors, who found excellent assistants in
those who never rose to the height of sculpture. The finest
work of this kind in Florence is the silver reredos for the
Baptistery (mentioned at p. 130), which was never quite
finished. The growing taste for ornamental vessels and
other objects favoured this branch of art; as did also the
custom of presenting silver helmets or pieces of plate to
commanders and others who had deserved well of the Republic.
As early as the summer of 1397, 436 florins were
paid to the goldsmiths Piero, Matteo and Donato, for silver
gold and enamel, for dishes (<i>bacinetti</i>) intended for the
generals Paolo Orsini, Giovanni Colonna and Bernardin de
Serre. Antonio del Pollaiuolo made a large silver dish for
the Signoria, and various ornaments for rich families; and
the churches were adorned with silver crucifixes and elegant
lamps.</p>

<p>Die-cutting was only a branch of sculpture and the goldsmith’s
art, sure to be practised where these two arts
flourished, and contemporary history furnished a store of
materials. But here the Tuscans do not hold the foremost
place, either in time or in excellence of workmanship. Natives
of Northern Italy, Lombards, and Venetians, came before
them in the great cast portrait-medallions, by which Vittore
Pisanello made a name in the fifteenth century. Donatello’s
followers strove to follow but never came up to him. Three
of the Tuscan medallists&mdash;Antonio Pollaiuolo, Bertoldo, and
Andrea Guazzalotti of Prato, had dealings with the Medici.
Only the first is known to have struck a medal referring to
his country’s history, namely, one relating to the Pazzi conspiracy.
Guazzalotti, who was in correspondence with Lorenzo
and cast statues for him, commemorated the Pope and the
Duke of Calabria as victors over the Turks; the medals are
characteristically conceived, but lacking in delicacy of treatment.
Medals of Cosimo and of Filippo de’ Medici, Archbishop
of Pisa, are attributed to Pisanello, the latter probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
incorrectly; a medallion with the head of Lorenzo seems to
be the work of a Florentine, Pietro di Niccolò.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Yet another branch of art reached a high perfection in
Florence&mdash;that of engraving precious stones. The taste for
engraved gems, which kept pace with the increasing knowledge
of antiquity and the passion for books and antique
works of all kinds, revived the art of cutting cameos and
precious stones. A good example of the growth of this taste
is related by Vespasiano da Bisticci in the ‘Life of Niccoli,’<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
whose house was full of antiquities. Passing along the
street one day, he saw a boy wearing round his neck a
chalcedony with a figure engraved, which the learned man
thought he recognised as a work of Polycletes. He inquired
the name of the boy’s father, and sent to ask him whether he
would sell the stone. The man was willing to let him have
it for five florins, which he thought good payment. Now, in
the days of Pope Eugene, the future Cardinal Luigi Scarampi&mdash;who
had much taste for matters of this sort&mdash;being
in Florence, asked Niccoli to show him the stone, and offered
him two hundred ducats for it. Niccoli, who was not rich,
accepted, and the chalcedony passed into the hands of
Scarampi, then to Paul II., and, after his death, to Lorenzo
de’ Medici. Lorenzo’s uncle, Giovanni, had collected many
gems, of which not the least famous was the carnelian representing
Apollo and Marsyas. It was supposed to be Nero’s
seal, and was set in gold by Lorenzo Ghiberti.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Lorenzo
considerably increased the collection of antique gems inherited
from his father, and formed a treasury, of which
numerous remains still exist, after all the disasters that befell
his posterity. He and Paul II. inspired this branch of art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
with new life, and enabled modern workers to enter the lists
against the ancients. The first modern gem of known date,
is a portrait of Pope Paul in 1470, now in the Uffizi collection.
Giovanni delle Corniuole formed himself on the
models in the Medici collection, and attained the perfection
conspicuous in his famous head of Savonarola. He had a
competitor in the Milanese Domenico de’ Cammei, who
worked chiefly for Lodovico il Moro, and to whom is attributed
the portrait of Lorenzo on an onyx of three strata,
placed with that of the great Dominican in the Uffizi collection.
Many other stones, with subjects taken from mythology,
sacred history, &amp;c., are works of this period, when, also,
much antique work was copied. The name of Lorenzo de’
Medici, to be read on many gems in Florence and elsewhere,
recalls the former wealth told of in Latin verses, and in the
testimonies of contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>In painting we now witness the development of the tendencies
which first appeared in Masaccio, and were so actively
reciprocated by the sister-art of sculpture. Here the
two branches of art frequently met, and their reciprocal
influence is discernible in the character of the work. It was
thus with Verrocchio, and the Pollaiuoli. The former, of no
great distinction as a painter, recalls his bronze works in his
picture of the Baptism of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The brothers Pollaiuoli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
whose grave, quiet faces may be seen together on their tomb
in San Pietro in Vincoli at Rome, cannot well be separated
in their works; and, though Piero occupied himself with
painting more than Antonio, the inscription by the latter on
the monument of Pope Sixtus IV. shows his excellence in
gold and silver work, in painting, and bronze casting. Antonio
painted for Lorenzo the Labours of Hercules, of which
some small copies are still in existence. The picture of St.
James was painted for the chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal;
that of the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> the most famous
work of these painters, was executed in 1475, for the Pucci
chapel in the entrance-court of the Annunziata. In these
works may be recognised the sculptor, and the student of
anatomy, to whom fidelity in representing the figure is more
important than the feeling for beauty. Alesso Baldovinetti,
who was probably a pupil of Uccello, and a fellow-worker of
Andrea del Castagno, experienced the influence of sculpture
indirectly; and where he might have learned from it, in
regard to modelling, he has only acquired a constrained,
angular style, which is far from pleasing. An example of
this may be seen in his picture of the Madonna enthroned
with saints, painted for the villa at Caffaggiuolo, and now in
the Uffizi collection. More satisfactory is a work executed
from a design of his&mdash;the picture of Dante in Sta. Maria del
Fiore which represents the <i>altissimo Poeta</i> in the attitude of
speaking, with his open book in his hand; on his right is
hell, on his left the city of Florence, in the background the
Mount of Purgatory, above his head the firmament. This
picture was actually attributed to Orcagna, till the artist’s
name&mdash;Domenico di Michelino&mdash;and the date of execution,
1466, were discovered.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Benozzo Gozzoli’s most important works&mdash;his Pisan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
frescoes&mdash;were executed from 1469 onwards; they display
great creative power, though the harmony is defective and
the masses and spaces are ill distributed. It is observable
in the works of Filippo Lippi, Gozzoli, and Baldovinetti, a
far inferior artist, that the custom was growing in Florence
of introducing into historical and religious compositions portraits
of spectators who had nothing to do with the subject.
Nothing remains of the frescoes painted by Baldovinetti for
the Gianfigliazzi in the choir of Sta. Trinità; they contained
portraits of Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici, Bongianni and
others of the Gianfigliazzi, Luigi Guicciardini, Luca Pitti,
Diotisalvi Neroni, Filippo Strozzi, Lorenzo della Volpaia,
and Paolo Toscanelli.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> This branch of painting reached its
highest development in the hands of Baldovinetti’s famous
pupil, Domenico Ghirlandajo. Sandro Botticelli and Filippino
Lippi pursued the same branch of art. The former learned
the goldsmith’s trade in his youth, and shows traces of the
influence of the Pollaiuoli. He was the pupil of Fra Filippo
and became the master of his son, whom he survived, though
Filippino was his junior by twenty years. In the paintings
of both there is a peculiar fantastic element, attractive and
interesting at first, but tiresome after a time. In the faces
it degenerates into a constantly recurring type, and in the
composition becomes mannerism. The way, too, in which
both painters employ allegory increases the appearance of
affectation. Yet both were men of great talent, with a fine
and delicate sense of beauty when not marred by superficiality
and exaggeration. Both had much to do with
Lorenzo. None of the pictures painted for him by Botticelli
are now in existence, but his fine picture of the Epiphany
must have been a commission from the Medici, for in this
work (formerly in Sta. Maria Novella, and now in the Uffizi)
the Three Kings have the features of three members of the
family&mdash;Cosimo the elder, his younger son Giovanni, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
grandson Giuliano.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The colouring is more like that of
Ghirlandajo, to whom the picture was long attributed, than
the brighter, thinner tone of most of Botticelli’s works.
Florence contains many of his allegorical pictures, as well
as Madonnas and saints; among them the Coronation of
the Virgin, painted for the church of San Marco, as a commission
for the Silk-workers’ Guild.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Botticelli not only
introduced likenesses into his historical pictures, he painted
separate portraits; among them those of Lorenzo’s mother
and Giuliano’s early lost love, the ‘bella Simonetta,’ very
pleasing in the gentle simplicity which characterises her
expression, her attitude, and even her dress. Both heads
are in profile, the contour a little exaggerated, in the manner
of this artist.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Botticelli’s close connection with the Medici
is shown by the circumstance that after the conspiracy of
the Pazzi he undertook to paint the likenesses of the conspirators
on the wall of the palace of the Podestà.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Only one work of Filippino Lippi is mentioned as having
been executed for Lorenzo&mdash;the unfinished fresco, representing
a sacrifice, in the hall at Poggio a Cajano&mdash;but their
intimacy is well known. The commission given to Filippino
by Cardinal Olivieri Caraffa for the painting of his chapel in
Sta. Maria sopra Minerva is said to have been procured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Lorenzo, and so, probably, were those of Matthias Corvinus.
The influence exercised on the views and tendencies of the
son by his father’s works, especially those at Prato&mdash;where
Filippino passed most of his youth&mdash;was mingled with that
of Botticelli. The former comes out most in the earlier
works, notably in the frescoes of the Brancacci chapel at
San Pietro in Carmine, painted about 1485; the latter in
the wall-paintings begun for Filippo Strozzi, but not finished
till long after, in the chapel in Sta. Maria Novella. The
immediate neighbourhood of Masaccio’s works had, no doubt,
a beneficial effect on the young artist in his earlier works,
for Filippino, not yet thirty, shows in the Brancacci frescoes
infinitely more fidelity to nature and feeling for historical
composition than in the paintings of the Caraffa and Strozzi
chapels. The scenes in the last,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> from the Acts and legends
of the Apostles, display undeniable tokens of spirit and
imagination, giving a vivid representation of the passions.
But there is affected mannerism, inharmonious colouring,
and an apparent delight in light tints playing into each
other. Some of these defects may be partly laid to the
account of restoration. The preference, noticeable in Botticelli,
for antique accessories, produces in Filippino an effect
of artificial overloading. Among his easel-pieces, the great
Madonna with saints, painted in 1485 for the council-chamber
of the palace of the Signoria, is distinguished by
grace and earnest work.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Filippino, too, was fond of introducing
figures of contemporaries. In his frescoes at S.
Pietro in Carmine may be seen Tommaso Soderini, Piero
Guicciardini (father of the historian), Luigi Pulci, Antonio
Pollaiuolo, Sandro Botticelli, Francesco Granacci, and the
painter himself. In an altar-piece (now in the Uffizi), representing
the Epiphany, are portraits of several members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the younger branch of the Medici, doubtless benefactors
of the convent of San Donato, for which the picture was
painted four years after Lorenzo’s death. There are Pierfrancesco,
grandson of Giovanni di Bicci, his son Giovanni,
father of the famous leader of the Black Bands and grandfather
of the first Grand-Duke, and the younger Pierfrancesco,
father of Lorenzino, the murderer of the first Duke of
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Other portraits, such as those of the Nerli family
in Sto. Spirito, represent donors. In Cosimo Rosselli’s
greatest work, the Procession with the Chalice in the church
of Sant’Ambrogio, only one portrait is named, that of Pico
della Mirandola. In Lucca, where Rosselli painted a good
deal, he fell into the reigning fashion. He had formed himself
on the model, first of Fra Angelico, then of Benozzo
Gozzoli, and with moderate talents endeavoured to combine
the conventional with the naturalistic tendency.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The highest achievements of painting in Lorenzo’s days
were those of Domenico Ghirlandajo. He is a nobler
Benozzo, guided by a refined sense of symmetry. His power
of drawing figures and groups is combined with variety and
animation. He has a strong feeling for historical character,
and makes a moderate use of architecture and accessories
that heighten the interest of his compositions without seeming
obtrusive. What he lacks in point of ideality is compensated
by his love of nature and that cultivated sense of
form which makes him select natural beauty and avoid
whatever is repulsive in the reality. His scenes from Scripture
and the history of the Saints are full of figures, and
produce a grand, often a solemn, effect without being at all
forced or far-fetched. They transport us, undisturbed by
anything foreign or strange, into the Florence of his day.
We seem to stand in the middle of that gay and busy life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
among the gallant active citizens and the stately, beautiful
women of that city, which, according to the inscription&mdash;doubtless
Poliziano’s&mdash;on the picture in the choir of Sta.
Maria Novella of the Angel appearing to Zacharias, was
rich in the spoils of victory and the treasures of art, in noble
buildings, in plenty, health, and peace.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Ghirlandajo’s
frescoes are a sort of monumental glorification of Lorenzo’s
latter years. Among the many portraits which give these
works a value, independent of their qualities as works of
art, may be seen Lorenzo’s in the Sassetti chapel in Sta.
Trinità, which was decorated in 1485 with scenes from the
history of St. Francis of Assisi. The frescoes in the choir
of Sta. Maria Novella make quite a portrait gallery. They
were begun in 1490 for Giovanni Tornabuoni, and after five
years’ work were finished four years before the death of the
painter, who is here seen at his best. Here are limned
many members of the Tornabuoni and Tornaquinci families
(between whom there was a connection), as well as numerous
friends&mdash;Ficino, Landino, Poliziano, Gentile of Urbino,
the most distinguished scholars of the time. Baldovinetti,
too, is there; David Ghirlandajo, Domenico’s brother; his
brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi and himself; Andrea de’
Medici, Federigo Sassetti, Gianfrancesco Ridolfi&mdash;a partner
in the Medicean bank&mdash;besides noble ladies and matrons,
among whom is Ginevra de’ Benci, a famous beauty also
painted by Leonardo da Vinci, and another pleasing face,
that of Giovanna degli Albizzi, who married Lorenzo Tornabuoni
in 1486.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Like the Brancacci chapel, the choir of Sta. Maria
Novella was a school for painters in the palmy days of art;
Andrea del Sarto, in particular, received a great impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from the compositions of Ghirlandajo. When it is considered
that the latter was taken away in the full strength
of manhood, at the age of forty-five, and that his development
was not rapid, it is hard to understand how he could
have executed so many works in Florence and elsewhere.
The frescoes may have been done in part by his pupils, but
the easel-pieces&mdash;of which there are so many, executed with
the most careful technical perfection&mdash;must have come chiefly
from his own hand. Of those in Florence it will suffice to
name one, the fine Epiphany painted in 1488 for the church
of the Foundling Hospital. For Lorenzo, in 1488, he painted
in the villa at Spedaletto some mythological subjects of
Vulcan and his comrades, of which little now remains. For
Giovanni de’ Medici he did two altar-pieces in the abbey
church of San Giusto near Volterra, of which one, ‘Christ in
the act of Blessing, with Saints,’ still exists. But Ghirlandajo’s
chief patrons were the Tornabuoni, family connections
of the Medici. That he and several other Tuscan artists
were sent for to Rome to decorate the Sixtine Chapel may
safely be attributed to these two families. About twenty
years before the close of the century&mdash;when Sandro Botticelli,
Cosimo Rosselli, and his pupil Piero di Cosimo, were
painting there with and after Ghirlandajo&mdash;the Pope and
Lorenzo were reconciled; and as in Florence nothing was
ever done in matters of art without him, he and Giovanni
Tornabuoni doubtless procured these commissions.</p>

<p>The diplomatic, literary, and artistic intercourse between
Florence and Rome had never been so active and fertile as
in those days when the predominance of Florentine influence
in Rome was openly acknowledged. Almost all the remarkable
works of the time of Sixtus IV. are due to Florentine
architects, sculptors, and painters. They may have
commenced even before the Pazzi conspiracy, for Baccio
Pontelli began to build the chapel in 1473, and Sixtus was
urgent for its completion. Beside the Florentine painters
above named two other Tuscans were employed, Don Bartolommeo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
della Gatta, abbot of a small Camaldulensian
convent at Arezzo, and perhaps a Florentine by birth, and
Luca Signorelli of Cortona, who by his connection with
Piero della Francesca forms a link between Tuscan and
Umbrian art. His chief works belong to an Umbrian city,
Orvieto, where indeed Tuscan masters had long taken the
lead. Luca Signorelli also painted for Lorenzo. A Madonna,
once in the villa at Castello now in the Uffizi, and a mythological
picture, the ‘Education of Pan,’ seem to have been
offerings of the artist to his patron. The last-named picture
recalls the grandeur of conception and strong feeling for
form noticeable in the frescoes in the chapel of San Brizio
in Orvieto Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The head of the Umbrian school in the latter decades of
the century, Pietro Perugino, made repeated and long visits
to Florence, and was considerably influenced by Florentine
art, though with an admixture of other elements. Thus
was formed a style which, opposed on the one hand to the
naturalism of most of the Florentines, on the other to the
enthusiastic tendencies of some among them, gave expression
to the religious element which long remained dominant
in the master’s own country and beyond it. It is ascertained
that Perugino was in Florence in 1482 and in the beginning
of 1491, but nothing is known of what he did then. His
chief works in Florence are of later date, as are those of his
school, first among which is the ‘Last Supper,’ in Sant’
Onofrio, probably by Bernardino Pinturicchio. In 1496,
Perugino had thoughts of building a house in Florence, and
in 1515&mdash;when his talent was on the wane&mdash;he purchased a
future resting-place in the Annunziata; such tokens did he
give of his attachment to the city which, spite of the superhuman
activity of Rome, was yet the focus of all artist-life
and work. Of paintings by Perugino for the Medici nothing
is known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Miniature painting<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> rapidly approached its highest development.
Great illuminated church-books, antiphonaries,
psalters, hours, breviaries, &amp;c., had come forth from Benedictine,
Camaldulensian, Dominican, and other convents,
and were lodged in cathedrals and churches. The art of
illumination was extended by Dante’s contemporaries, Oderigi
of Gubbio and Franco of Bologna, to prayer-books for private
use and to works of profane literature, when men of rank
and citizens took to forming libraries and beautiful manuscripts
became objects of luxury. The field for representation
was correspondingly enlarged, and from figures of
angels and saints the artists of the fifteenth century passed
to scenes from the classic poets or the ‘Divine Comedy.’
In this century the Florentine churches were filled with the
finest works of this kind, most of which are now in the
National Library or that of San Marco. The Dominican
order were especially rich in miniature painters after Giovanni
Dominici had given an impulse to this branch of
art. In Cosimo’s time, Fra Angelico and Fra Benedetto
worked in San Marco under the eyes of St. Antonine. Don
Bartolommeo della Gatta, Attavante degli Attavanti, Gherardo
and Monti di Giovanni, Zanobi Strozzi, Francesco
Rosselli, brother of Cosimo, and many others, distinguished
themselves in this art, in which they were emulated by
foreigners connected with Florence: Liberale of Verona,
Girolamo of Cremona, several Sienese, and others. From
the middle of the century miniature painting underwent the
influence of the Van Eyck school. Many beautiful works
found their way into the Medici collections. Lorenzo’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
tastes and traditions were inherited by his son Giovanni,
whom Raphael’s famous portrait represents with a book
adorned with miniatures, and a glass for looking at them
lying before him. Many miniatures went abroad, and
foreign ones came to Italy. Gherardo, Attavanti, and
others worked for Matthias Corvinus; and in the Burgundian
Library at Brussels is preserved the mass-book painted for
the king by the last-named artist in 1485, and brought to
the Netherlands by Mary of Hungary, sister of Charles V.
At Matthias’s death Lorenzo acquired several of the manuscripts,
probably ordered at his own instigation, and some
of which were still in hand. Lorenzo was deeply interested
in the revival of mosaic. Vasari’s statement that Alesso
Baldovinetti learned the long-forgotten principles of this art
from a German pilgrim going to Rome must rest on its own
merits; anyhow, the art was revived in Lorenzo’s latter
years. In 1482-83, Baldovinetti undertook to restore the
mosaics in the Baptistery. About 1490, Gherardo di Giovanni
and Domenico Ghirlandajo began for Lorenzo the
mosaic decoration of the chapel in the choir of the cathedral,
where stands the shrine of St. Zanobi. This work was never
finished. The same year Domenico executed the pleasing
mosaic picture of the ‘Annunciation,’ over the side-door of
the church, towards the Via de’ Servi. Baldovinetti’s pupil
Graffione, and Ghirlandajo’s brother David, took part in
these works; the latter, who busied himself with the technicalities
of glass-making at Montaione, in the Elsa valley&mdash;where
there are potteries and glass-houses to this day&mdash;afterwards
worked both in Florence and in the cathedrals of
Siena and Orvieto.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Thus varied and fruitful was the development of art
around Lorenzo, in a great measure stimulated and shared
in by him. Like his grandfather, he was not content to
profit by ripe talents and pluck the fruits, he sowed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
future; he, more than any one else, contributed to bring on
the most brilliant period of art. He founded a nursery for
choice spirits in the collection of works of art of all kinds,
ancient and modern, which he laid out in his garden at San
Marco and the neighbouring casino, and the superintendence
of which he confided to Donatello’s pupil, Bertoldo. At a
time when antique sculptures were rare, and the means of
study limited, and when young men of talent had to remain
for years in a dependent position which checked their individual
development, advantages like these, offered to youth,
were as unusual as they were invaluable. Lorenzo’s sound
judgment was no less useful here than his goodwill. ‘It
is no small matter,’ remarks Vasari in the ‘Life of Giovan
Francesco Rustici,’<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> ‘that distinction was attained by all
those who went to school in the Medici garden, and were
assisted by the illustrious Lorenzo. This can only be ascribed
to the uncommon perspicacity of that noble gentleman,
who was a veritable Mæcenas, who knew how to recognise
genius and merit, and to encourage them by rewards.’
The painters Francesco Granacci, Lorenzo di Credi, Niccolò
Soggi; the sculptors Giovan Francesco Rustici, Pietro
Torrigiano, Baccio of Montelupo, Andrea Contucci of Monte
San Sovino&mdash;who on Lorenzo’s recommendation was summoned
to Portugal, where he executed works of architecture
and sculpture for King John II.&mdash;these, and others, came
forth from the garden of San Marco. The variety of their
gifts and accomplishments bears witness to the freedom they
had there enjoyed in the development of the most diverse
intellectual powers. But the one who gave to the Medicean
garden a worldwide fame was Michelangelo Buonarotti.
Before he was fifteen he passed from the school of Ghirlandajo
into this new world. His sculptures soon disclosed the
marvellous talent which his sympathetic teacher had foreboded
when he recommended him and Granacci to Lorenzo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the latter having, as the story goes, expressed to his artist-friend
a regret that sculpture did not keep pace with painting.
The youth came of a good family, but without property.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
During the few remaining years of Lorenzo, he enjoyed a
sympathy and kindness which had a decided influence on
his life up to the threshold of old age, although the independent
spirit of the free citizen often rebelled against the
attachment which, as artist, he continued to feel for the
Medici.</p>

<p>It has been generally believed that the greatest Florentine
artist of the second half of the fifteenth century&mdash;Leonardo
da Vinci&mdash;was a stranger to Lorenzo. The fact
appeared the more strange because Leonardo was the son of
a chancellor or notary of the Republic, and a pupil of Andrea
del Verocchio, who was in constant intercourse with the
Medici. Newly discovered documents<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> show that Leonardo,
if not among those admitted to study in the San Marco
gardens, was at least acquainted with the Medici, and that
it was Lorenzo who sent him, when thirty years old, to
Lodovico il Moro, in company with one Atalante Migliorotti,
famous for playing on the lyre. The date hitherto assigned
to his first visit to Milan&mdash;1482 or 1483&mdash;is confirmed; but
there is no explanation of the fact that his name is never
mentioned during the war of 1478-79. He was then twenty-six,
and might have done good service to his country by that
knowledge of mechanics and hydraulics which he afterwards
turned to such good account in Lombardy. On January 1 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the fatal year 1478, the Signoria commissioned him to paint
an altar-piece for the chapel dedicated to St. Bernard in
the palace. This commission, like many of the same kind,
was not executed, but was transferred after Leonardo’s departure
for Milan to Filippino Lippi, whose beautiful
Madonna (see p. 175) was placed not in the chapel, but in
the council chamber. Under the rule of the two Sforzas&mdash;Gian
Galeazzo and Lodovico il Moro&mdash;Leonardo founded at
Milan a school of painting which gave a new direction to
Lombard art. When he returned to Florence after the
downfall of the Moro, Lorenzo had been seven years in his
grave, and his sons were in exile.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">CHANGE IN THE FLORENTINE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> events of two years had shown that Lorenzo was not
quite so secure of the direction of public affairs as he had
seemed to be immediately after the conspiracy of the Pazzi.
The vicissitudes of the war had produced an abrupt change
in public feeling; it had become clear that internal affairs
were in a great measure subject to external influences. Even
when Lorenzo’s position was far stronger, a diplomatist
justly observed that his authority in the city depended on
the estimation in which he was held by the other Italian
powers and by foreign sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The traditions of independence
were too fresh, party interests too various and too
powerful, not to create constant difficulties. The great art
of the party leaders had always consisted in excluding from
office any but their own partisans. But it was by no means
easy to prevent internal divisions between sections of the
parties themselves. During the war, a college of magistrates
had to be dismissed, on account of the opposition they
offered to a measure which aimed at reducing their jurisdiction
to its original limits. Lorenzo’s standing difficulty
was the necessity he was under of controlling parties in the
state, without altering constitutional forms except in apparent
agreement with the popular sentiment. The ostracism
known as the power of <i>ammonire</i> had proved just as dangerous
as the excitement caused by the frequent summoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of parliaments. His only plan therefore was, by creating a
docile following, to exclude, without the use of strong
measures, all elements he could not rely upon, and to accustom
the multitude to the gradual extension of his influence
on home as well as foreign policy. Lorenzo had another
motive. He had not been fortunate in business matters.
During his grandfather’s time the State finances had become
entangled with those of the family. Cosimo, who was a
financial genius, took care of his own interests without
letting those of the State suffer. With his grandson the
case was different. Cosimo had advanced money to the
State; Lorenzo, on the other hand, stood in need of public
money for private objects. The expenses of the war,
sacrifices and losses of all kinds were the ostensible cause of
irregularity in the payment of interest on the national debt,
and in the settlement of marriage portions by the establishment
existing for that purpose. This state of things could
not last if the public bonds were to retain any value and the
national credit to be maintained. For further operations,
rendered hazardous by the embarrassment that already existed,
men were needed who were both familiar with business
and willing to go hand in hand with the director of the
State. The embarrassment was already so publicly known,
that it was thought advisable to avow it with apparent
frankness before taking measures which really aimed at
withdrawing the direction of the banks from public control,
although their object was made to appear a reform for the
general welfare.</p>

<p>On April 8, 1480, scarcely a fortnight after peace was
proclaimed, the Signoria, who were all in Lorenzo’s confidence,
proceeded, without the intervention of a parliament,
to make sweeping changes in the constitution. They carried
through the three legislative councils a resolution empowering
them to create a new college, in whose hands were to be
placed all the appointments to public offices. This college
was divided into a smaller and greater council: the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
consisting of thirty citizens capable of holding office, elected
with the Signoria; the latter containing 210 members not
under thirty years of age, who with the Signoria and first
college filled up the required number of offices. The presence
of two-thirds of the members and a proportionate majority
of those present sufficed for the validity of the proceedings.
One-fourth of the councillors were to come from each quarter
of the city; if a family or <i>consorteria</i> had sent but one representative
among the thirty, two of its members were eligible
as councillors; otherwise only one, except in the case of two
houses to be named by the Signoria and the thirty, for
which there was to be no limit as to number or age. The
210 then added to their body 48 other members, and thus
formed a great council of 288 members, which was to meet
in November for the elections. On April 11 the Signoria
proceeded to nominate the thirty. But a few days later
a considerable modification was made in the scheme, for on
the 19th the smaller council of thirty was increased by a
resolution of the Signoria to seventy; the additional members
being chosen by those already nominated. The new
members were to be at least forty years old, and, if belonging
to one of the great guilds, must have held the office of
Gonfaloniere. This permanent senate of seventy, which now
took the place of the former electors to the offices (<i>accoppiatori</i>),
was divided into two equal parts, alternating every
half year. When united, it had in fact the direction of the
whole state; the more so because it had the right of filling
up vacancies in its own body from among those who had
held the office of Gonfaloniere, provided they had done
nothing to displease the ruling party. To this senate no
proposal or petition could be addressed by private persons,
but only by the Signoria.</p>

<p>The Council of Seventy then appointed two committees
of its own members. The first, commonly called from its
number the <i>Otto di pratica</i>, took the place of the Magistracy
of Ten. It sat only in time of war, and assumed the control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of political and military affairs, which, after deliberation in
full session, it submitted to the Seventy. The other committee,
consisting of twelve members, was entrusted with all
affairs concerning the national credit, and all matters of
jurisdiction. Both were nominated for a period of six
months, and any vacancies caused by death or an appointment
to offices abroad were to be filled up from the same
college.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The existing magistracy, called the <i>Otto di balia</i>,
whose authority in both civil and criminal affairs had almost
extinguished that of the podestà but had lately been reduced
within narrower limits, was likewise chosen from
among the Seventy.</p>

<p>However widely the opinions of contemporaries and posterity
may differ as to the character and scope of these institutions,
which were afterwards greatly modified in the direction
of centralisation, all agree that the measures just
described contributed most effectively to the establishment
of personal government. ‘One must perceive,’ observes
Alamanno Rinuccini on the first resolution, ‘that all freedom
was taken from the people and they were made the servants
of the Thirty, as I, Alamanno Rinuccini, though a member
of the Council of the Two Hundred and Ten, testify in accordance
with truth.’ And further, on the completion of the
scheme: ‘The decree contained many things dishonourable
and opposed to citizen-life and to the freedom of the people;
and, indeed, from that day their freedom seemed to me dead
and buried.’ The general opinion on the connection of the
administration with the financial affairs of the Medici is
shown by the remarks of both friends and foes. Giovanni
Cambi remarks: ‘Lorenzo was always thinking how he could
increase his authority. After the new reform had conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
on the electors a power formerly belonging to the whole body
of citizens, the former took into their own hands the money
matters that needed regulating. The state finances had
been used to support Lorenzo in his private affairs. More
than a hundred thousand gold florins went to Bruges alone,
where Tommaso Portinari was at the head of the Medici
bank, then in danger of failure. The unfortunate community
had to pay it all, for the members of the new elective body
cared for nothing but to keep their own position, and assented
to everything. Thus a servile feeling gained ground;
the citizens sacrificed their freedom to obtain office. Yet
what they did obtain was not enough to satisfy them; for all
looked enviously on the inner council, to which each thought
himself worthy to belong.’ The voice that carries most
weight is perhaps that of Alessandro de’ Pazzi, who gives a
sketch of his uncle in his disquisition on the Florentine constitution
of 1522. ‘As Lorenzo,’ he says,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> ‘spent a great
deal of money on a thousand things, and was not a good
man of business, his fortune suffered considerably. Cosimo
had spent large sums of money; perhaps because he believed
that the glory of building churches and monuments would
be of more advantage to his family than stores of gold; and
in this his example was followed by Piero and his sons.
When their credit fell, they would have been driven from
their position but for the events of 1478, which gained for
the Medici new friends and confirmed the attachment of old
ones, and altogether strengthened their power. The same
events furnished Lorenzo with the means of using both his
private means and the moneys of the State, which before he
would not have dared to touch, to fulfil his own obligations,
and re-establish his political influence on a permanent basis
while rectifying his financial embarrassments.’</p>

<p>The altered constitution with respect to finance is thus
described by Niccolò Valori:<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> ‘Although no new taxes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
imposed, the revenues of the State increased so much after
peace was assured, that State-creditors had reason to be
satisfied. The Republic has such good resources that she
can hold out long in time of war, and recover rapidly in
time of peace.’ This sounds very well; but, according to
Alamanno Rinuccini,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> the public credit had to be supported
in the course of the very next year by a sale of State property.
The bad name which Lorenzo acquired by his arbitrary appropriation
of public moneys seems to have induced him to
restrict his banking operations, which depended for success
on changes of fortune and on the skill of agents, and to lay
out his means in landed property rather than trust to foreign
speculations.</p>

<p>If Niccolò Valori is to be believed, no new taxes were
imposed in 1480. But an examination of the proceedings of
the board of taxation shows how little this statement is to
be relied on. The progressive scale of 1447, which originally
produced the large sums laid out in supporting Francesco
Sforza, and which was to be in operation for three years only,
the tax being collected in small instalments as need arose,
had remained in force during the remaining years of Cosimo,
and with some modifications under Piero and his son. According
to a calculation of the payments in 1471-1480, the
sum total amounted to 1,682,888, or on an average 168,288
gold florins annually. In 1479 the tax had risen to 367,450
gold florins. The new law issued by the new finance committee
on May 18, 1480, and modified on the following
January 30, introduced a double progressive duty in place of
the former one. The first, fixed for seven years, was on
immovable property, so that the lowest class, with an income
extending beyond the actual necessaries of life but
under fifty gold florins, was to pay seven per cent., and the
highest, having an income of 400 and over, twenty-two per
cent. The second was a personal tax, which, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the same scale, amounted to one gold florin and four-twentieths
for the lowest class, four florins and four-twentieths
for the highest. This mode of taxation, whereby
a quota of the national debt could be discharged, lasted with
some changes till Lorenzo’s death; its real aim being to
keep the lower orders in good humour and weaken the
great families; while those that governed always found
means to indemnify themselves and their friends, so that
equality of taxation was merely apparent. The taxes were
collected according to the needs of the Government. More
than once they were paid seven times in the year. The
proceeds at one collection of the first of these taxes had been
estimated at about 30,000 gold florins, but only yielded
25,000; in 1487 it fell to 18,000; and in the following year
to 15,000. From 1481 to 1492 the sum of the tax payments
amounted to 1,561,836 gold florins, or, on an average, 130,153.
The largest revenue was that of the year 1483&mdash;that of the
Ferrara war&mdash;viz. 164,665, and the smallest those of the
years of peace, from 1489 to 1492, viz. 105,000. Under
Lorenzo’s son the total annual amount was reduced to 90,000.
On calculating the various duties on both movable and immovable
property, appearing under manifold names, ever
changing with circumstances, alternately rising and falling,
it becomes evident that the direct tax, which by the old
financial system of the Republic was limited to 25,000 or
30,000 gold florins, a light weight in the balance against the
duties estimated at 250,000 to 300,000, had increased twelvefold
in Lorenzo’s time. The taxpayers were indeed registered
at the Monte, and might discharge part of their payments in
its bonds. But the Monte more than once stopped paying
interest altogether, often paid only half, and sometimes only
a fifth. The exchequer then took the quotas of taxes in
question not at the nominal value of the bonds, but according
to the rate of payment then current at the Monte. All
these manipulations, which made the artificial financial
system of Florence a perfect labyrinth of perplexity, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
not but be injurious to the interests of the community, while
they deprived property of its secure foundations.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, the repeated modifications in the constitution
which had been going on ever since Cosimo’s time
had thrown it completely off the balance. People had long
been accustomed to see the exercise of popular sovereignty
by means of parliaments converted into a mere party
manœuvre. The men in power, in order to gain a formal
legal countenance for their measures, would have some extraordinary
authority conferred on them by the so-called people,
i.e. by that portion of the citizens who were either on their
side or were coerced into becoming so through fear. The
constant change in the mode of election to the offices, either
by lot or by nomination, produced in the end no great difference,
for all were excluded who were not thought to have
been made sure of. In Lorenzo’s time, at least after the
restrictions subsequently imposed on the scheme introduced
in 1480, there was no more trouble in that respect. In
defiance of democratic forms, everything tended to a personal
government. As if enough had not already occurred to increase
the power of the Medici, another circumstance&mdash;unimportant
in itself&mdash;occurred to raise Lorenzo’s position.
On the evening of June 2, Amoretto Baldovinetti, natural
son of a citizen of good family, was arrested, and on the
following morning Battista Frescobaldi, formerly consul at
Constantinople. Scarcely were they in custody when an
attempt was made to seize the brothers Francesco and
Antonio Balducci, but only the latter was captured. Immediately
a report was spread of a conspiracy against Lorenzo’s
life. Frescobaldi had once greatly assisted in delivering up
Giovanni Bandini to justice, and seems to have thought
himself insufficiently rewarded for having spent some of his
private means in the affair. In Rome he met some Florentine
emigrants who put him in communication with Amoretto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
just the man, he considered, for a hazardous undertaking.
Provided with weapons and poison, these two came to
Florence. Their efforts to gain supporters had little success;
even the brothers Balducci seem to have been undecided.
Nevertheless they resolved to attempt the assassination,
and again in a church; according to some it was to be
in the cathedral, according to others in S. Pietro in Carmine,
where Lorenzo was expected on Ascension day. The plot
failed and the three conspirators were condemned to death.
A legal objection was raised against the sentence, as the
case was only that of a criminal project; but the Signoria
and the Council of Seventy pronounced it high treason, and
enacted that in future every act by which Lorenzo was
injured or his life threatened was to be regarded in the
same light. ‘Lorenzo’s position and authority,’ remarks
the Ferrarese agent,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> ‘was certainly heightened by this
event, but many are of opinion that it did him more harm
than good, by increasing the number of his enemies.’ When
sentence was pronounced many citizens went to console the
prisoners; but they answered cheerfully that they regretted
not so much the sentence they had to undergo as the
failure of their scheme to free the city; they had tried to
do what ought to be the duty of every citizen, and if they
had only had two hours more it would have been seen of
what they were capable. They met their doom on the
morning of the 6th, on the gallows in the palace of the
Podestà. Lorenzo took care to announce to the courts and
to his noble friends throughout Italy, either by private
letters or through the ambassadors of the Republic, the
danger with which he had been threatened ‘by that traitor
Battista Frescobaldi and his companions.’ The consequence
was that the following of friends and clients which had
served to protect Lorenzo since the Pazzi conspiracy formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
itself into a regular body-guard, and the capital became
accustomed to see him appear in public with a suite differing
from that of a tyrant only by the civil character of its
members.</p>

<p>Three months after this Otranto was re-taken. In the
beginning of the year the plenipotentiaries of the Italian
States had met at Rome to consider an alliance in which
foreign countries were invited to join against the Infidels.
Sixtus IV. bestirred himself actively. With help from various
quarters, King Ferrante made great exertions to meet the
danger that was threatening not only Apulia but all Italy.
Alfonso of Calabria besieged Otranto with a large force. As
he could not succeed in completely cutting off the approach
by sea, the town might have held out a long time, particularly
as a new Turkish army was gathering on the Albanian
and Dalmatian coasts; but the death of the Grand Signor,
and the strife of his two sons for the throne, put an end to
the resistance of the place. On September 10, Otranto
opened its gates, but it never recovered from these heavy
strokes of fate. The duke, whose easy victory was commemorated
by medals, did not keep to the conditions of the
surrender. A year later, Rome, so lately threatened by the
Turks, saw many of them within her walls, not as victors
but as doubly vanquished; they were those who had taken
service in the Neapolitan army, which thus once again&mdash;as
in the days of Frederic II.&mdash;numbered unbelievers in its
ranks.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FERRARESE WAR.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> Pazzi conspiracy was only a prelude to the events
which caused a Neapolitan army to stand as an enemy before
the walls of Rome. The Pope and the Venetians had had
no time to give free course to their spite against old enemies
or former allies so long as the storm was hanging over the
Apulian coast. Sixtus IV. even showed himself friendly to
the Florentines, and Guid’Antonio Vespucci, who, towards
the end of January 1481, returned to Rome as ambassador,
endeavoured to strengthen this good understanding. But
no sooner had the imminent danger from the East disappeared
than the object of clearing the coast of Albania
and Western Greece of the Turks, which might have been
more easily attained then than at any previous period, passed
out of sight. A dispute between Venice and Ferrara furnished
an occasion for fresh strife. Ercole of Este refused
to recognise any longer as valid certain old and burdensome
obligations which kept him in a sort of dependence on the
Republic with respect to the execution of justice in his
capital by a Venetian vicegerent, and the procuring of salt
from Venetian saltworks. The dispute rose to such a height
that Venice threatened to take up arms; she thought the
moment favourable on account of her alliance with the Pope.
Sixtus IV. had sound reasons for avoiding everything that
could favour the interference of Venice in the affairs of
Ferrara and Romagna; but the requirements of prudent
policy were driven into the background by the selfish ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of his nephew, who hoped to strengthen his position
in Romagna by Venetian influence. Duke Ercole vainly
tried through Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere to make the
Pope understand that it would be neither to the honour nor
the advantage of the Holy See to leave him to be crushed
by the superior power of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Girolamo Riario went to Venice, where he was most
honourably received and presented with the patriciate.
War was decided on. King Ferrante sided with his son-in-law,
as did also Milan and Florence. The alliance of Bologna
and several of the lords of Romagna was secure; Siena and
Genoa adhered to the Pope and Venice. Most of the captains
of the Tuscan war undertook the leadership again,
under somewhat altered circumstances. Besides Roberto
Malatesta, the Venetians gained Roberto da Sanseverino,
who had fallen out with Lodovico Sforza and given him a
great deal of trouble in his own territory. The command of
the Milanese troops was entrusted to the Duke of Urbino.
The Florentines were led by Costanzo Sforza, to whom the
general’s <i>bâton</i> had been solemnly presented October 2,
1481.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In the spring of 1482 the struggle began in several
quarters at once.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>A large Venetian fleet sailed up the Po, while two armies
attacked the Ferrarese territory&mdash;Sanseverino from the
Lombard side and Malatesta from that of Romagna. Rovigo
and the whole Polesina fell into the hands of the Venetians,
whose commander-in-chief encamped, on May 28, before
Ficcarolo&mdash;a castle situated on the Po to the north-west of
Ferrara&mdash;intending to take it, and then to cross the river
and attack the capital, Malatesta co-operating with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
from the south side. But meanwhile the Duke of Urbino,
with the Milanese troops, raised his camp at Stellata, on the
right bank, to assist the besieged and cover Ferrara; and
Malatesta was called away from the Po district to meet a
threatened danger in an opposite quarter. Alfonso of Calabria
had appeared at the Tronto, demanding a free pass to
bring aid to his brother-in-law. The Pope had not yet declared
himself; the envoys of Naples, Milan, Florence, and
Ferrara were still in Rome. On the refusal of the pass they
left the city, and the duke entered the States of the Church
as an enemy. He met no serious resistance. Rome resounded
with the clang of arms; as an annalist says, ‘The
city which had hitherto been wont to produce only bulls and
briefs now produced nothing but arms.’<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Girolamo Riario
had the post of captain-general for the Church, but his incapacity
soon became apparent. The Neapolitans were at
Grottaferrata; their horsemen made excursions to the very
gates of the city; vineyards and fields were laid waste. This
state of things continued for weeks. At last the Pope saw
himself compelled to appeal for help to Venice, and she
ordered Roberto Malatesta to go to the assistance of her
hard-pressed ally. Meanwhile, the Florentines had made a
diversion; Niccolò Vitelli, supported by Costanzo Sforza,
had taken Città di Castello on June 19, and the whole
country around had fallen into his hands.</p>

<p>Thus far matters seemed to be going in favour of the
Duke of Ferrara and his allies. The Pope was angry as
well as distressed, and in his anger and distress he did not
disdain the policy followed by one Italian state after another,
to the ruin of Italy, the policy of seeking help from a foreign
power. To Louis XI. he addressed the bitterest complaints
against Ferrante, seeking to stir up the French king to an
expedition against Naples, where the prevailing discontent
was in his favour, and he offered the Dauphin an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of becoming a standard-bearer of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Raimond
Pérault, afterwards Bishop of Saintes and Cardinal, was
sent to the king with positive proposals. Louis XI. was
too practical to enter upon such far-reaching and uncertain
projects, but, as in all similar proposals, the seed sown did not
fall on barren soil. Meanwhile things had changed in Italy.
Ficcarolo surrendered after a siege of rather more than a
month, and the enemy crossed the Po unimpeded by the troops
of the Duke of Urbino, which were no match for the Venetians,
especially when their leader, having been seized with fever in
the low unhealthy neighbourhood of the river, had to be
carried to Bologna. Ferrara was threatened, and a Venetian
fleet alarmed the coast of Apulia. But the heaviest blow
was yet to come. On August 21, at Campomorto, on the
road from Rome to Porto d’Anzo, Alfonso of Calabria was
completely defeated by Malatesta, with heavy loss of men
and artillery.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The victor died at Rome on September 8,
of fever which he had caught in the infected Campagna.
At the same time the other side lost their best general,
Federigo da Montefeltro, who closed his eventful life in
Bologna. These two, opposed to each other on the battle-field,
but connected by the closest family ties, each ignorant
of the other’s mortal danger, commended in their last hour
their states and families to each other’s care. Girolamo
Riario had tried to profit both by the victory and the death
of Malatesta, on the one hand to retake Città di Castello,
and on the other to get Rimini into his own power. Both
attempts were frustrated by the Florentines, who supported
Vitelli and enabled Roberto’s widow, Elisabetta di Montefeltro,
to preserve for her little step-son Pandolfo his paternal
inheritance. Still the situation was very serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Roberto Sanseverino established himself on the right bank
of the Po, and raised strong fortifications at Pontelagoscuro,
close to Ferrara. The duke began seriously to think of
abandoning his capital and withdrawing to Modena, but
the Florentine plenipotentiary, Bongianni Gianfigliazzi, restrained
him. Lodovico Sforza was kept in check by a
rising in the Parmesan territory.</p>

<p>The way the war was carried on in the Duchy of Ferrara
was regarded in Florence as very unsatisfactory. The Duke
of Urbino had in nowise answered to the expectations formed
of him. Jacopo Guicciardini remarked to the Ferrarese
ambassador that the league had no head. Lorenzo de’
Medici was anxious, but said in reference to the Duke of
Ferrara, ‘I cannot imagine you will lose, unless you fail for
want of spirit. <i>Here</i> all will be done that can be.’ The
expedition against Città di Castello, he observed, had been
made with the object of giving the duke breathing time.
Ercole was always commending his interests to the Republic.
If Ferrara fell into the hands of the Venetians, Florence
would be likewise endangered. Military operations were
not accounted sufficient; the old threat of a council was
renewed. But just at this time the adventurous Archbishop
of Carniola, whose character and history have never been
thoroughly investigated, made a feeble attempt to revive
the Synod of Basel, which had been dissolved for forty
years. This man, a Dominican, whose name seems to have
been Andrea Zuccalmaglio, was in Rome with commissions
from the Emperor Frederic about the time of the Pazzi
conspiracy. There he enjoyed high favour for a time, but
afterwards he fell into such deep disgrace that he was not
only deposed from his ecclesiastical dignity but imprisoned
in the castle of St. Angelo, from whence the Emperor’s
intercession liberated him in the summer of 1481. He
betook himself, <i>viâ</i> Florence, first to Bern and then to
Basel, where, falsely giving himself out as still Frederic’s
messenger, and finally assuming the title of cardinal, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
proclaimed the opening of the great Assembly of the Church
on the feast of the Annunciation, 1482. The moment for
this proclamation was not badly chosen, for the Pope was
just involving himself in a fresh war; but measures being
immediately taken in Rome to put on their guard both
foreign powers and the free city in which the fire threatened
to kindle once more, the wretched man&mdash;whose sanity had
begun to be doubted, and who was not joined by one single
prelate from France or Germany&mdash;rushed into extremities,
and in the beginning of the summer launched the wildest
invectives against Francesco da Savona, who was no Pope
but a son of the devil, against whom he called Christ and
the œcumenical council to witness.</p>

<p>Not long before, Lorenzo had found out that it is not
safe to play with spiritual weapons, however much they
might be blunted by misuse in temporal projects. It seems,
therefore, hardly intelligible that he could think of letting
himself appear to take part in such a senseless enterprise.
Possibly he had seen the archbishop when the latter passed
through Florence, with his heart full of rancour against the
Pope and his nephew. In Lorenzo’s defence it may be urged
that affairs in Italy were in a sad plight while the Pope
blindly allowed himself to be led by the ambition of his kinsmen.
In a letter written about this time to Pier Capponi,
ambassador at Naples,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Lorenzo says plainly that the authority
of religion itself is endangered by a mode of government
so unbecoming the supreme pastor. King Ferrante nominated
ambassadors to the council, and proposed that the Italian
League should be represented, as well as the individual
states. He hoped to induce the Kings of Hungary and
Spain to favour the cause. But in vain. On September 14,
by Lorenzo’s orders, Baccio Ugolini arrived in Basel, in
company with a Milanese delegate&mdash;Bartolommeo, Archpriest
of Piacenza. They at once entered into communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with the <i>Pronunciator</i> of the Council, as Andrea called
himself, but they soon became convinced of the utter groundlessness
and hopelessness of the whole proceeding. The
Florentine’s idea of proposing Pisa as a more suitable spot
than Basel, where matters were going wrong already, is interesting
only as an echo of the Council of 1409, and a foreshadowing
of the <i>conciliabulum</i> of 1511. On December 18,
the two delegates, with Philip of Savoy, Lord of Bresse, and
other princes and nobles, were present at a solemn sitting of
the town-council of Basel, at which the case was decided
against the archbishop. Having avowed his obedience to
the head of the Empire, and his zeal for the good of the
church, but declining to retract his accusations against the
Pope, he was arrested; he was then prosecuted, but at the
same time, the town council of Basel refused to deliver
him up to Rome. Legal proceedings were taken against the
imperial city, and were the cause of great trouble, until the
dispute was ended by a compromise arising out of the suicide
of the rash man who had originated this melancholy episode.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>While Baccio Ugolini and his colleague were taking part
in these deliberations, a revolution was preparing in Italy
which altered the whole position of affairs and placed Florence
and Milan in quite a different attitude towards the Pope.
Sixtus was influenced less by distant apprehensions than by
the consideration, to which he could not shut his eyes,
that he was helping to strengthen the very power which
threatened to become most dangerous to him by its constant
endeavours to obtain control over the cities on the Adriatic
coast. Giuliano della Rovere&mdash;who, twenty years after, as
his uncle’s successor, opposed in arms the power of this Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
his uncle’s old ally&mdash;seems to have been the means
of finally inducing the Pope to break with Venice. Girolamo
Riario, the soul of the war party, might be gained over by a
prospect of the Malatesta fiefs. First, a truce was made
with the Duke of Calabria, who was still in the Campagna;
then, on December 23, peace was agreed upon between the
Pope, Naples, Florence, and Milan, with a proviso that
Venice was to accede to it. The Florentines were not satisfied
with the conditions, and seem to have accused the
Milanese of lukewarmness both in regard to the war and to
the negotiations. Yet, considering the state of affairs and
the losses already sustained, the conditions were not unfavourable.
The Duke of Ferrara, who was in the utmost
need, was to be reinstated in his possessions. The next
point, however, was to persuade or compel the Venetians to
accede to the treaty, and thus give reality to the peace, in
commemoration of which Sixtus built the church of Sta.
Maria della Pace. A congress was to be held at Cremona
to regulate everything.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose, for Ferrara was besieged and
could not hold out much longer; and the conduct of Costanzo
Sforza, who had strengthened the garrison with his
own troops after being repeatedly urged to do so by the
Florentines, inspired but little confidence. In spite of the
unfavourable time of year, King Ferrante was not behind
hand. A thousand men, among whom were the Turks who
bad fought bravely at Campomorto, were sent by sea to
Piombino, to march through Sienese and Florentine territory;
while the Duke of Calabria advanced by way of
Orvieto towards the valleys of the Chiana and the Arno.
On January 5, 1483, he was in Florence, where he abode in
the house of Giovanni Tornabuoni. At the end of three
days he set out for Ferrara, from whence he intended proceeding
to Cremona. The Cardinal-Legate Gonzaga also
passed through Florence on his way to Cremona; and now
Lorenzo de’ Medici, who was to represent the Republic at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the congress, also set out on February 12. A week before
he received the customary instructions,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> relating principally
to the contingents of troops and money for the prosecution
of the war; in fact, he went as master of the city and the
State, to decide on war and peace according to his own
judgment. His brother-in-law Bernardo Rucellai was to accompany
him. Louis XI. warned him of possible danger.
‘As to the meeting about Ferrara,’ he wrote on January 20,
‘at which you tell me you have agreed to be present, I, who
know neither the people nor the place, would have advised
you not to go, but to take care of your own safety. I would
have sent a messenger with excuses. Since, however, you
have consented to go, I must leave the rest to you and trust
in God that all may go as you wish.’<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Even in Florence the
matter seems to have been thought somewhat serious.
When Lorenzo, on January 30, announced to the Duke of
Ferrara<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> his intended departure, he added that he had to
contend with the general opposition of the citizens, who
were unwilling to let him go. At the same time he remarks
that his presence cannot be of much consequence at a meeting
of so many mighty lords; but it is not necessary to take
him at his word. He announced his impending journey to
the French king on the same day.</p>

<p>The lords who met at Cremona were, besides the Legate,
the Duke of Calabria and Lorenzo de’ Medici, Lodovico and
Ascanio Sforza, Ercole d’Este, Federigo Gonzaga Marquis of
Mantua, Giovanni Bentivoglio, Girolamo Riario,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and various
envoys and plenipotentiaries. On the last day of February,
1483, the treaty was settled, according to which Venice was
to be compelled by active prosecution of the war to cease hostilities
against Ferrara. At the end of the first week in March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Lorenzo was back in Florence. The Venetians had no idea
of yielding. They had already begun negotiations with the
Duke of Lorraine, that he might alarm King Ferrante once
more by raising the standard of Anjou, while their fleet
desolated the Apulian coast and took the important post of
Gallipoli. Their ambassador Francesco Diedo had quitted
Rome at the end of February. The Pope had refused to
give him an audience; Diedo complained that no Turk
would be treated so, but he feared a crusade would be
preached against the Republic, and declared that in that
case they would never obtain peace&mdash;they might give themselves
up for lost.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> In March, Ferrara seemed near its fall.
All the country within a mile round was in the enemy’s
hands. The Venetian Chronicler Marin Sanuto, who was in
Sanseverino’s camp, gives a lively description of the doings
before the city-gates. ‘We eat with the most illustrious
Roberto, and then to horse. We were about five hundred
horsemen and many foot; we left the camp and rode to the
park of Ferrara, where we proceeded <i>more solito</i> as far as a
small canal, about a mile and a half from the city. Sanseverino
was wont to march into the park every morning to
escort the plundering bands. I saw the enemy’s troops
under the Duke of Calabria and the Count of Pitigliano;
we advanced towards them as far as the canal, but, <i>sic
volente fato</i>, it did not come to a fight. Only, to mock them,
we let fly our falcons. The park comprises a space of seven
miles, full of game and fruit of all kinds; now it lies open
and deserted.’<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Costanzo Sforza, who had thoughts of
making terms with Venice, evacuated Ferrara in defiance of
orders. Giovanni Bentivoglio and Galeotto Manfredi were
hastily ordered thither; but the most effectual help was the
victory gained over the Venetians at Argenta by Alfonso of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Calabria, captain-general of the allies. From thenceforth
matters took a favourable turn for the latter, who were also
benefited by the interdict laid on Venice by the Pope. An
attempt made by Sanseverino to kindle a revolt in the
Milanese roused Sforza to serious proceedings. By autumn
the whole country as far as the Adige was in the hands of
the Milanese; the Venetian fleet on the Po sustained heavy
loss, and René of Lorraine, called by the Republic to its aid,
was forced to retreat before the troops of Este.</p>

<p>In the beginning of January 1484, at Milan, another
congress was held, at which Jacopo Guicciardini was present
on behalf of Florence. By actively prosecuting the war by
land and sea, it was hoped that Venice would soon be compelled
to sue for peace&mdash;a consummation for which all
longed, as the expenses were becoming burdensome, and
each of the allies had its own separate interests. Peace did
indeed come to pass in the course of the summer; but it
scarcely answered general expectation. To obtain a little
relief in their difficult predicament, the Venetians, beside
their alliance with the heir of Anjou, now tried to stir up
Louis XI. to an expedition against Naples, and the Duke of
Orleans to an expedition against Milan, while their enemies
were setting the Turks upon them.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> At last they succeeded
in detaching Lodovico il Moro from the league, of which
he was but a half-hearted adherent. His own position and
projects furnished them with a pretext, and now began the
complications which in ten years brought Italy to ruin. In
Milan things had drifted into a state that might easily have
been foreseen. The duchess-regent, who, <i>par sottise</i>, as Commines
unceremoniously expressed it, had put herself into
Lodovico’s power, now saw her truest counsellor dying in
prison at Pavia, her own son used as a tool, and her unworthy
favourite driven out of Milan; and when she tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to leave the country she was herself detained in the castle of
Abbiategrasso, a prisoner, though the word itself was not
uttered in her presence, and she was allowed to see her
children occasionally. There she closed her sorrowful
career in 1494, so completely forgotten that the exact date
and manner of her death are unknown. Lodovico once rid
of his sister-in-law, ruled supreme in Milan. His nephew
was duke only in name; at sixteen he was still under a
guardianship which became daily more oppressive. Alfonso
of Calabria, to whose daughter the young duke was betrothed,
was not inclined to let this state of affairs continue; Lodovico,
on the other hand, was determined to make every
possible effort to maintain his position. The Marquis of
Mantua had contrived to prevent the rupture which seemed
imminent when both princes were in Northern Italy; but
his death put an end to all chances of mediation. The reciprocal
distrust of Lodovico and the Medici was constantly
increasing, and occasionally sharp words passed between
them.</p>

<p>Venice profited in this state of affairs by employing
Roberto da Sanseverino, an old confidant of Lodovico’s and
anxious to be reconciled to him, to make him perceive that
he was acting against his own interest in taking part in this
war, which, if it ended unfavourably for the Republic, must
strengthen the authority of the Aragonese in Central and
Northern Italy. Without troubling himself about his allies,
Lodovico entered into negotiations, in which Naples and
Florence participated, because they could not venture to
carry on the war without Milan. Pier Filippo Pandolfini
took part in the arrangements for peace, as Florentine plenipotentiary.
Lorenzo de’ Medici, who had need of Sforza, was
full of distrust. ‘We shall conquer,’ said he after the Congress
of Cremona, ‘if Lodovico’s words correspond to his
thoughts.’<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> But he soon discovered that his doubts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
well founded. He could not help seeing how all the advantages
that had been gained were being given up, and that
an inadequate result of the long and costly war was all that
Este could obtain by the treaty. ‘Antonio,’ said he to the
Ferrarese ambassador, ‘thou rememberest that I was once
in the same position in which thy lord is now&mdash;aye, and
even worse. If I had not helped myself, I should have been
lost. Then, too, the fault lay with Milan. I do not say
that thy lord should do as I did.’ ‘My illustrious lord,’
adds the ambassador in his report to the duke, ‘I think he
meant that if he was in your Excellency’s place he would
come to an understanding direct with Venice herself, and
trust himself to his foes as he did at Naples.’<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The conditions of the peace signed at Bagnolo on August
8, 1484, were dictated by Venice, who regained by the treaty
the territory she had lost in the war. That is to say
the peace was highly disadvantageous to Ferrara. Not only
was Ercole compelled to admit the old demands of the Republic;
the Polesina and Rovigo remained in its hands.
‘When the Venetians were getting the worst of it, and their
funds were becoming very much exhausted,’ says Commines,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
‘the lord Lodovico came to the assistance of their
honour and credit, and every man got his own again except
the poor Duke of Ferrara, who had gone into the war at the
instigation of his father-in-law and Lodovico, and now had
to yield to the Venetians the Polesina, which they still possess.
It was said that the transaction brought 60,000
ducats to my lord Lodovico; I cannot tell how the truth
may be, but I found such was the belief of the Duke of
Ferrara, to whose daughter, however, he was not yet married
in those days.’ Gallipoli and other places on the coast were
restored to Ferrante. Sixtus IV. having thus seen the war
continued contrary to his views, and ended without his participation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
when he thought he had the decision in his own
hands, did not long survive the conclusion of the peace,
which made all his exertions useless and strengthened his
opponent. He had an attack of gout on August 2; on the
13th he died. It was said that he, the restless one, had
been killed by the peace. Scarcely five months before, he
had given the red hat to the brother of the man who had since
crossed all his plans&mdash;to Ascanio Maria Sforza, who thus
began under warlike auspices a cardinalate destined to be
devoid of peace.</p>

<p>The Florentines felt all the shame of the treaty, but they
made a show of rejoicing after the war was over. There was
indeed every reason to wish for quiet in that quarter, for
there was no lack of troubles of all kinds. It was not long
since a compromise had with great difficulty been arrived at
about Città di Castello. The Pope had tried both arms and
negotiations to regain possession of the town, and neither
had succeeded. Niccolò Vitelli held out till 1484, by the
Florentine assistance. Florence had indeed no intention of
offending the Pope for his sake, and thereby damaging the
far more important cause of Ferrara, and was inclined to let
Sixtus have his will in the matter. But he wanted to give
the town and neighbouring places as a fief to his nephew,
and at the same time to enlarge the latter’s possessions in
the direction of Rimini and Cesena by a treaty with the
Malatestas, neither of which things suited the Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Amid this uncertainty Vitelli resolved to imitate Lorenzo’s
example. He went to Rome, came to terms with the Pope,
recognised the latter’s supremacy, agreed with his rival
Lorenzo Giustini, and accepted the office of a governor of
the Maritima and Campagna. Peace was restored in the
valley of the Upper Tiber, and Città di Castello was preserved
to the Church; while the Vitelli, who continued to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
through various changes of form and destiny, maintained
till their extinction their active relations with Florence and
the Medici. On June 14, 1483, an agreement was made with
Siena for the restoration of the places which Florence had
been compelled to yield to her in the treaty of peace of
1480.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> But another revolution in Siena, where the party
raised to power by the Duke of Calabria’s influence had been
unable to maintain themselves, had been required to produce
this restoration and decide the Sienese to form an alliance
with Florence, to secure herself against the exiles supposed
to be favoured by Rome and Naples. The Florentine opinion
of the neighbouring state was still the same as that expressed
nearly two hundred years before by the poet of the ‘Divine
Comedy,’<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> as may be seen by a letter from the Signoria to
Lorenzo during his stay at Cremona. The treaty with the
Sienese, say they, is a long process, and no real confidence
can be placed in them and their doings, because of the
changeableness of their nature.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The long feud about Sarzana had not yet come to an
end; the siege had dragged on all through the Ferrarese
war. Things were in a bad position. Agostino Fregoso,
who held the town, had made it over to the great commercial
company of the Banco di San Giorgio, which formed in
Genoa a state within the State, and owned many places on the
Ligurian coast as well as in the far-off Crimea. Not only
had the garrison of Sarzana been strengthened, but also
that of its neighbour Pietrasanta, originally a Lucchese
town, which cut off all communications while a fleet attacked
the coast of the Maremma. As at the peace of Naples so
at that of Bagnolo, to the great vexation of the Florentines,
the dispute about Sarzana was left unsettled. The honour
of the Republic urgently demanded a settlement. But instead
of taking the place, a Florentine corps escorting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
transport of ammunition was defeated near Pietrasanta.
The necessity was now felt for rendering the castle incapable
of further harm, but it was not done without heavy losses.
The marshy atmosphere of the coast of the Lunigiana seized
many victims from the Florentine camp; Bongianni Gianfigliazzi
and Antonio Pucci, army commissaries, succumbed
to the fever in Pisa. Then Lorenzo resolved to go himself
to the camp to spur on the troops. A few days after his
arrival, in the beginning of November, 1484, Pietrasanta
surrendered. An embassy from Lucca, demanding its restoration,
was deferred with a reference to the coming
accommodation with Genoa; but Florence was resolved
beforehand to keep the place as an excellent check upon
Lucca. When the castle was taken, which was to remain
a boundary-mark on the Lunigiana side down to the dissolution
of the Tuscan autonomy, many things had occurred
to claim the whole attention of those who governed the
Republic.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE EARLY YEARS OF INNOCENT VIII. LOUIS XI. AND FRANCE.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> last years of Sixtus IV. were disturbed in Rome as well
as elsewhere. In both cases Girolamo Riario was the chief
person to blame, though it was a great pity that such a
gifted and superior man as the Pope should be led astray
into crooked ways by a petty tyrant devoid of talent, hesitating
before no violence, and versed only in intrigue. Sixtus
could not be deceived as to the nature of his unworthy
nephew; all Rome was full of his wickedness, though
the excesses committed by the Florentines after the Pazzi
conspiracy had damaged their cause and would have added
to the power of the Pope if he, too, had not overstepped all
bounds in his impetuosity. Of Riario’s part in the matter
there was but one opinion. Two years later a painful occurrence
took place in the Pope’s family. One of his numerous
nephews, Antonio Basso della Rovere, son of his sister
Luchina and brother of Cardinal Girolamo Basso, had been
married only a year to Caterina Marzano, daughter of the
Prince of Rossano and granddaughter of King Ferrante,
when he was seized with a fever from which he never recovered.
Girolamo Riario was visiting his cousin when the
latter (whether, as the chronicler suggests, in the delirium
of fever, or venting long-restrained malice), instead of
thanking him for his sympathy, attacked him as if he were
his bitterest enemy. ‘He vehemently reproached him with
various actions which were universally condemned, and with
his manner of life, which was a subject of general complaint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and denounced against him the judgment of God, which no
human favour or power could enable him to escape. The
sick man’s excitement was so great that those who had been
intimate with him for years could no longer recognise his
usual gentleness. The count, however, wisely bore it all
patiently as the words of one delirious with fever, and
openly expressed his compassion for his cousin’s state. All
we who stood round the bed blushed for shame, and several
tried to leave the room.’<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Since 1482 Rome had been constantly filled with the
clang of arms. The stronghold of the spiritual power was
scarcely to be recognised. After the immediate anxieties
consequent on the Ferrarese war were ended by the battle
of Campomorto, and the Romans had stared to their hearts’
content at the Duke of Calabria’s captive troopers and janissaries,
feverish excitement was again aroused by fresh disputes
between the Colonna and Orsini factions, in which
many other families&mdash;the Savelli, Santacroce, Tuttivilla,
Della Valle, &amp;c.&mdash;took part. The city was divided into two
hostile camps; palaces were besieged and destroyed; the
streets and the neighbourhood filled with armed bands. One
Colonna lost his life in defending the cause of his family.
Girolamo Riario was mixed up in all this, and through
him the Pope also became a party to it. Cardinal Giuliano
della Rovere, who favoured the Colonnas, quarrelled so
desperately with Girolamo that the latter threatened to
attack his palace. Even after a compact was agreed upon
by the two great families, peace was not restored. In the
beginning of July, 1484, the Pope’s nephew, with a considerable
body of troops, attacked the Colonna possessions, which
surrounded Rome on the west like a girdle. He took
Capranica and Cave, and was laying siege to the stronghold
of Paliano when he was startled by the news of the Pope’s
death. He felt the ground give way under his feet. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the morning of August 13 the populace stormed and plundered
his palace at Sant’Apollinare; his magazine in the
Campagna, that of his brother-in-law and of the Genoese&mdash;hated
by the people for their usury&mdash;the papal galleys at
Ostia, everything was sacked. His brave wife, Caterina
Sforza, was safe in the castle of St. Angelo. The siege of
Paliano was raised at once; the troops marched to Rome,
but only to turn towards the north-west to seek a junction
with the Orsini, for from all sides, even from the Abruzzi,
armed auxiliaries were flocking to the Colonna, to whom
Florence and Siena also proffered assistance. Deifebo dell’
Anguillara retook several castles; the city and neighbourhood
were in complete anarchy; every man was in arms, and
the palaces were barricaded. At last a compromise was
arrived at, which, by the departure of the party leaders and
the surrender of the castle of St. Angelo to the College of
Cardinals, put an end to the worst disorder. On August 26
the conclave met, and at the end of three days Giovan
Battista Cybò was chosen Pope under the title of Innocent
VIII.</p>

<p>Thus, amid all this confusion, ended the reign of a Pope
who had thought he could govern the policy of Italy, and, in
a certain sense, did control it better than anyone who had
preceded him. He brought together the finest library of
his time, carried out legal reforms for the benefit of the
Roman Municipium, did more than anyone else to transform
Rome from a mediæval city into one more suited to modern
requirements, and enriched it with churches, palaces, bridges,
and beneficent establishments. Innocent VIII. was far from
possessing the striking qualities of his predecessor, but he
was free from the latter’s immoderate self-confidence. He
sprang from a Genoese family believed to be of Levantine
origin and connected with the Tomacelli, relatives of Boniface
IX.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But the first Cybò known to history is the Pope’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
father Arano, who married into a Genoese patrician house&mdash;that
of the Mari&mdash;held important offices in Naples under
René of Anjou, and later on, though still leaning towards
the Angevin party, under Alfonso of Aragon, and in 1455
was a senator of Rome. Giovan Battista Cybò studied in
Padua and Rome, was appointed Bishop of Savona by Paul
II., and afterwards translated to Molfetta, from whence he
took his usual appellation after being created a cardinal in
May 1473. In the Pope’s absence, during the plague in the
summer of 1476, he acted as his representative. He was in
his fifty-second year. ‘The disposition of the new Pope,’
wrote Guid’Antonio Vespucci to Lorenzo immediately after
the election, ‘was, during his cardinalate, benevolent and
kind, and he was far more affable in society than he whom
you wot of. He is not versed in either matters of state or
of learning, but he is not wholly ignorant. He belonged
completely to the party of San Pietro in Vincola (Giuliano
della Rovere), who procured him his hat, and of whom it
may be said that he is now practically Pope, and will have
far more power than under Sixtus if he only knows how to
manage his successor cleverly. The latter, as a cardinal,
was on bad terms with the count (Riario). He is of middle
height, strongly built, full in the face, has a brother and
several grown-up natural children, at any rate a son and a
married daughter. He gives one the impression of one who
will let himself be counselled by others rather than rule by
himself.’<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Luigi Lotti wrote: ‘If he governs and proceeds
according to his own judgment and not by that of others, I
think he will be a good quiet Pope, and keep clear of all
strife of arms. His court will resemble him, as the general
opinion is that he will show a gracious disposition.’</p>

<p>Lodovico il Moro had proposed that the allied states
should send their congratulatory embassies to Rome together.
The Florentines were all the more eager to offer their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
congratulations because they wanted to secure the favour of
a Genoese Pope in their differences with Genoa. Immediately
after his election Lorenzo heard, from his brother-in-law
the archbishop, that Innocent had expressed the most
friendly interest in his position and the affairs of Florence,
and declared his readiness to be of use to him; adding that
all his hopes were founded on Lorenzo’s wisdom, as there
was no knowing whether the end would correspond with the
beginning.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> At the close of November the embassy started
for Rome, where it arrived on December 8, and was received,
according to custom, by the papal court, the household
officers of the cardinals, and the foreign envoys. Its members
were Francesco Soderini, Antonio Canigiani, Bartolommeo
Scala, Angelo Niccolini, and Giovanni Tornabuoni,
besides the resident ambassador Guid’Antonio Vespucci.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
In the ‘Instructions’ reference was made to the earnest desire
of the Republic to have a speedy ending put to the strife in
the Lunigiana. ‘Should the new Pope or anyone else turn
the discourse on the subject of the war, ye shall answer that
your commission deals solely with the duty of congratulation;
but add, as if from yourselves, in justification of late
events, that we were compelled to fight contrary to our intention
and will; as indeed ye very well know that our city
is ever faithful to her natural desire for peace, as far as is
consistent with honour and fair advantage.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo had sent with the ambassadors his eldest son, a
lad of fourteen, as it was then customary for solemn embassies
to be accompanied by youths of high rank, who
might contribute to the splendour of processions and ceremonies.
He gave the boy detailed instructions, such as
were usual in such cases on the part of wise and careful
fathers.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> At Siena he was to proclaim the readiness of both
Lorenzo and the Government to be of use to the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
there. ‘Everywhere, when the other young companions of
the envoys are together with thee, behave thyself gravely
and discreetly and with politeness towards thine equals.
Beware of taking precedence of anyone older than thyself;
for although thou art my son, yet thou art nothing but a
Florentine citizen like the rest. If Giovanni (Tornabuoni)
thinks fit to present thee to the Pope at a special audience,
take care to be previously well instructed in all the customary
ceremonies; then, when thou comest to his Holiness,
kiss the credentials which I give thee for the Holy Father
and beg him to read them. After that, if thou hast to
speak, thou shalt commend me with reverence to his Holiness,
and say that I well know it was my duty to appear
before him in person as I did before his predecessor of
blessed memory, but that I trust he will be graciously
pleased to excuse me; for at the time when I went to Rome
I could leave my brother at home, who was well able to
represent me, but now I should have no one to leave behind
numbering more years or possessing more authority than
thyself. Therefore, I think I should have pleased his Holiness
less by coming than by sending thee, whereby I express
in the best way possible my desire to appear in person.
Moreover, I send thee in order that thou mayest have an
early opportunity of learning to know his Holiness as thy
father and lord, and of fostering for many years those feelings
which, I hope, will be shared by thy brothers, whom I
would rather not have as sons if it is not to be so. Hereupon
thou shalt declare to his Holiness my firm resolve not
to swerve from his commands, for my innate devotion to the
Apostolic See is increased by that towards the person of the
Holy Father, to whom our house has long been under obligation.
Moreover, I have experienced what disadvantages
were brought upon me by the loss of the late Pope’s favour,
although I believe I suffered many persecutions without
fault of my own, and more on account of the sins of others
than for misconduct towards him. But I leave this to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
judgment of others, and however this may be, my resolution
is fixed, not only never to offend his Holiness, but to meditate
day and night on what may be pleasing to him.’ Doubtless
Lorenzo was as much in earnest in this as in his sensible
advice. It would have been well for Piero de’ Medici had
he never forgotten what Cosimo had impressed on his son
and the latter again on his, who, as a father, now repeated it
to the boy&mdash;that he was a Florentine citizen like all the
rest. But this tradition came to an end with Lorenzo. The
further contents of the instructions will be referred to again.
Innocent VIII. afterwards said to Pier Filippo Pandolfini,
the new ambassador of the Republic, that after the Genoese
quarrel had been laid aside Lorenzo would perceive there
had never been a Pope who took the interests of his house
so much to heart as he did. ‘For as I have learned by experience
how great is his honesty and wisdom, I will most
willingly be guided by his counsels.’<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo must have been the more anxious to obtain the
lasting favour of the head of the Church since a change had
taken place abroad which might possibly have an important
influence on the political circumstances of Italy. A year
before the death of Sixtus IV. the monarch was called away,
who, amid all his dependence on the clergy and his devotion&mdash;approaching
to superstition, and heightened by suspicion
and torments of conscience&mdash;raised the most vehement
opposition to the Pope and the papacy. Louis XI. died at
the age of sixty, at his castle of Plessis-les-Tours, on the
evening of August 30, 1483. Two years before, when out
hunting, he had had his first apoplectic fit, which was repeated
without destroying his clearness of intellect, though
his physical strength gradually sank. He had seen his
approaching end with a terror which prayers and sacraments
could not soothe, which drove him ceaselessly from pilgrimage
to pilgrimage whenever he was not staying at Plessis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
There, tortured day and night by the consciousness of
hatred which his cold treacherous tyranny had excited in the
breasts of others, he shut himself in with a few confidants,
surrounded by double and triple guards of all kinds. To
the end of his days the king maintained friendly relations
with Florence and the Medici; of all his political connections,
this was perhaps the only one in which he never
changed. In his instructions to the ambassadors sent to
Rome in November 1478,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> he expressly mentioned that the
Florentines had always, time out of mind, shown themselves
true and loyal friends to France, had never done anything
against the crown, and lived according to the laws and
customs given them by Charles the Great.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> A few weeks
before his death, Louis wrote to Lorenzo. Not content with
having called to his bedside the holy hermit of Calabria,
St. Francis of Paola, and procured relics without end from
Rome, he tried through Lorenzo to obtain the episcopal
ring of St. Zanobi, which was preserved at Florence in the
Girolami family, and believed to have the power of curing
skin-diseases. His wish was gratified. ‘Cousin and friend,’
thus wrote the dying man on July 9, 1483, from Notre-Dame
de Cléry near Orleans, whither he had gone on a pilgrimage,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
‘I have seen the ring which you sent to Monsieur
de Soliers (Palamède de Fobrin, governor of Provence).
But I wish to know for certain whether it is really that of
the saint, and whether it works miracles; whether it has
cured anybody, and whom; and how it is to be worn. I
beg you to inform me of all this as quickly as you can, or to
write about it in detail to the general of Normandy; also
whether you have out yonder any particular cure which has
the virtues of the said ring. If you can find one, send it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the said general, I beg you, for the sake of all the pleasure
you can give me. Now farewell, cousin and friend.’</p>

<p>In the last years of Louis XI. the male line of the house
of Anjou became extinct. We have seen how the king obtained
from the last of the house, who could no longer
escape from his powerful arm, the cession of their French
provinces and their Italian claims: of the former he took
immediate possession, the latter remained in abeyance waiting
for eventualities which did not fail to come, to the ruin
of Italy, whose old sins were expiated centuries later. René,
a king of shadows if ever there was one, saw his son Jean
and his grandson Nicolas both die before he himself was
laid to rest at Angers on July 10, 1480. His nephew Charles,
Count of Maine, to whom his French possessions passed
with the consent of Louis XI., followed him to the grave
within seventeen months; and the sole heiress was now
René’s daughter Yolande, widow of Ferry, Count of Lorraine-Vaudemont.
She too died in the beginning of 1483, a few
months before the king. Her marriage with her cousin had
been intended to reconcile the claims of the Vaudemont
branch to the Duchy of Lorraine with those of primogeniture
in the female line on behalf of which René, as the husband
of the heiress Isabelle, had fought unsuccessfully with Antoine
de Vaudemont, father of Ferry. Yolande’s son, René II.,
now succeeded to the dukedom of Lorraine, as well as to the
French fiefs of the Vaudemonts. It was he who defeated
Charles the Bold at Nancy, and was led by the Venetians
into the war with King Ferrante in Italy, where years after,
in the war against the Spaniards, his son revived the old
family claims to the Neapolitan crown&mdash;those claims which
were to be practically made good once more in the middle
of the seventeenth century by a scion of the French branch
of the old house.</p>

<p>Lorenzo could not fail to notice that in Louis XI. he lost
both a friend and a supporter. The political situation of
France foreboded the worst vicissitudes. A delicate illtrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
boy of thirteen was left heir to a kingdom which
a long, skilful, and despotic reign had considerably enlarged,
but also filled more terribly than ever with the elements of
discord. The Queen-mother, Charlotte of Savoy, was an
invalid, and incapable of acting; according to Louis’ arrangements
his elder daughter Anne, wife of Pierre de Bourbon,
Count of Beaujeu, was to conduct the government for
Charles VIII. without the title of regent. Amid the opposition
of the nobles, of whom one, Louis of Orleans, was
the next heir to the throne, this task was fulfilled with no
little skill by the Princess, then aged twenty-two, of whom
her father once said that ‘no woman was wise, but Anne was
the least foolish.’ It was she who thwarted all the plans of
the restless nobles and put down their attempts to arm. She
paved the way for the union of Brittany with the crown, by
interfering with the views of Maximilian of Austria who,
after the early death of Mary of Burgundy, contemplated extending
the new possessions of the house of Habsburg into
the very heart of France by his marriage with the heiress of
the great western duchy. It is evident, however, that under
all the circumstances there was not much chance of French
influence extending into Italy or anywhere beyond the
borders of the country itself.</p>

<p>Immediately after the death of Louis, Florence despatched
an embassy to present to the young king good
wishes on his accession, and to express sincere regret for the
loss of his father.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Gentile Becchi, Antonio Canigiani, and
Lorenzo de’ Medici the son of Pier Francesco, were the
members of this embassy, which was to visit the potentates
of Northern Italy on its way. Its chief object was the fulfilment
of formalities. If any intention should be shown on
the French side of interfering to restore peace in Italy, the
envoys were instructed to take care that this should appear
to proceed from an independent resolve of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
government, and not from the influence of the allies (for at
that time the war with Venice was still going on). This
would be the best way ‘to avoid dangerous conjunctures which
might arise in Italy from these obstinate dissensions,’ and
at the same time remain most honourable for the young
king. But Anne de Beaujeu, who had just summoned the
States-General in order to checkmate the allied princes by
the same move which they had intended to make against her,
had other things to think of than Italian complications; and
the Florentine embassy, after all due ceremonies had been
gone through, seems to have had to deal merely with commercial
and personal interests.</p>

<p>Five years later the Regent of France remembered the
old friendship with the Medici, when she was looking about
her on all sides for help against the great feudatories who
supported Maximilian in his alliance with the mightiest of
them all, the Duke of Brittany. On April 5, 1486, Maximilian
was crowned king of the Romans at Aachen; and in
spite of the great difficulties with which he had to contend
in his Burgundian provinces, his position was a very threatening
one for France so long as internal peace was not restored,
and every addition to his power was an addition to the
cares of Anne de Beaujeu. The advanced age of Frederic III.
pointed to a speedy vacancy of the imperial throne. That
the idea occurred to France of trying to prevent Innocent
VIII. from confirming Maximilian’s election is, however,
somewhat startling. The Pope was on friendly terms
with the emperor and the king; just before, at the end of
1487, he had given proof of this by signing the treaty which
put an end to the long-standing war between Venice and
Archduke Sigismund of Tyrol. On February 8, 1488, a
letter was sent in the name of the young king Charles to
Lorenzo de’ Medici, claiming his friendship for the royal
house of France and soliciting the employment of his influence
with the Pope, in order that Maximilian’s kingly
dignity, as injurious to the interests of France, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
remain for a time unconfirmed. ‘You may assure the Holy
Father that if the matter is delayed, we will so conduct ourselves
that his Holiness and all who have anything to do in
the matter shall perceive the result.’<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>It is very clear that Lorenzo, with all his attachment to
France, was reluctant to mix himself with such an intrigue
as this. ‘By the copy of a letter from the King of France
to me,’ he wrote on February 8 to the ambassador at Rome,
‘you will see the king’s desire and the importance of the
affair. For practical reasons I do not think it fitting to
write to his Holiness; but I am for your informing him of
it with your usual adroitness as soon as you think good, and
pointing out to him its importance and possible consequences;
for I am of opinion that mature reflection and deliberation
are needful, that the investiture in question may not give
occasion to embarrassment and offence. According to my
judgment, the Most Christian king is so powerful and has so
much influence in the affairs of Christendom, that it will
always appear to me advisable to keep in harmony and
friendship with him. I shall always order myself according
to the wise judgment of his Holiness; but wish first fully
to express my own view. The rest I leave to you, and I
shall be glad if you can manage so that the king’s plenipotentiary
is pleased. But you will not neglect any precautions
which may appear needful, that we may not lose in one
quarter what we gain in another.’ Lorenzo was right in
his caution. ‘The French envoys,’ reports the Ferrarese
ambassador at Florence to his duke on March 10,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> ‘have
petitioned the Pope that he should not invest Maximilian
with the dignity of King of the Romans, declaring that,
should he do so, their king will set every influence to work
at Naples to avenge the insult. The Pope gave them a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
sharp reply, saying that no request had as yet been addressed
to him in relation to this matter by Maximilian’s
orators; and, moreover, he thought that such a message as
that just delivered to him must have come not from the
King of France, but from his evil counsellors. If he had
only the latter to deal with, he would soon be able to make
them understand how unworthy of a Pope was such a message,
and how his footstool deserved greater reverence.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">POLITICAL CARES. THE BARONS’ WAR.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">After</span> the disturbance and unrest which ended the pontificate
of Sixtus IV., the reign of Innocent VIII. seemed
destined to commence in peace and tranquillity. The
Pope’s desire to terminate the long dispute about Sarzana,
which had distracted the Lunigiana for years, and threatened
to assume dimensions greater than the worth of the
cause, was very honourable to him, especially as it did
not arise from partiality for his Genoese home. On September
17, only three weeks after his election, the Pope
summoned the ambassadors of Naples, Florence, and Milan<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
to discuss the political situation. After the recent conclusion
of peace, he said he considered it a duty of his apostolic
office to ensure that peace, in order that all the Italian states
might really enjoy its fruits and recover from the heavy expenses
which had burthened the holy see with a debt of
more than 250,000 ducats. The dispute about Sarzana,
complicated by the Florentine attack on Pietrasanta, made
him anxious in consideration of the disposition of the
Genoese; for the latter, where their honour was at stake,
would not scruple to set the world on fire, and had
already, in times past, called the foreigner into Italy. He
knew that they were not only in league with the Marquis of
Saluzzo and Philip of Savoy, lord of Bresse, but were trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to stir up the Duke of Orleans against Milan and the Duke
of Lorraine against Naples; in which they would get support
from France, as the regent was desirous to find occupation
for these princes, and sustenance for their numerous troops in
a foreign land. The commonwealth of Genoa had applied
to him to bring the matter to a legal conclusion. He knew
that his predecessor had made an unsuccessful attempt to do
so; but as a native of Genoa, and being in a more favourable
position than Pope Sixtus, he hoped to attain his object, as
the Signoria would doubtless do all in their power to compose
the strife.</p>

<p>The ambassadors of Naples and Milan kept to generalities,
though the former could not help owning that Sarzana
had been taken from the Florentines in time of truce; that
the blame really lay with the son of his king he naturally
could not admit. Vespucci, however, went thoroughly into
the matter. Sarzana, said he, was sold to the Republic by
Lodovico Fregoso, the lord of the place. After we had held
it for several years, his son Agostino took it by surprise in
time of truce, and as he did not feel able to keep it, made it
over to the bank of San Giorgio. In defiance of law and
custom, which forbid the acceptance of an object in dispute,
the bank received it just as if there were no such place as
Florence in the world. Florence has a perfect right to make
every effort to get back her own. She has equally a right to
attack Pietrasanta, because Pietrasanta is an obstacle and
an enemy to her. The Signoria, he added, has no thought
of giving your Holiness advice, which you do not need, and
is willing to agree to any reasonable compromise. But after
all the unsuccessful efforts of Pope Sixtus, there is not much
to be hoped. As to the possible introduction of foreigners
by the Genoese, that is a matter not to be deemed unworthy
of consideration, but it is not a ground for anxiety. The
Dukes of Orleans and Lorraine personally are not in a condition
to begin such an undertaking; and in the exhausted
state of France her rulers will never think of giving them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sou towards it. The Genoese alone would be utterly incapable
of holding out long, even were they differently inclined.
The Ferrarese ambassador offered his Duke’s
mediation in case of a negotiation. The Pope had also
consulted on the matter with Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and
expressed his anxiety to him; whereupon Lodovico il Moro
declared that nothing but the voluntary surrender of Sarzana
on the part of Genoa could render a satisfactory termination
possible.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Innocent’s mediation came to nothing. The
Florentines took Pietrasanta, as has been already related,
and the contest went on amid numberless suggestions of compromise
for fully three years more.</p>

<p>In vain the Pope honestly desired to make and to keep
peace; misunderstandings arose on all sides. In defiance of
their ostensible relations to each other, there was no true
understanding and confidence between Lorenzo de’ Medici
and Lodovico Sforza. The Moro’s conduct was always ambiguous;
not only in the matter of Sarzana, where there
was much underhand work going forward, but also in the
constant miserable disturbances in Romagna, where Girolamo
Riario, supported by him, was operating against the
Manfredi, they having given shelter to the Florentine’s
<i>protégé</i>, the claimant of Forlì, Antoniello Ordelaffi, and being
in alliance with the Bentivogli, who stood in equal fear of
Lodovico and the Pope’s nephew. Giovanni Bentivoglio was
in Tuscany in the beginning of 1485. He visited Siena,
Pisa, Lucca, and in May he came to Florence, where he
stayed with the Medici. He spoke out his mind unreservedly
about the Moro’s intrigues.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Lorenzo was absent at the
time; gout, the hereditary disease of the family, obliged him
constantly to visit various baths, and just then he was at
Bagno a Morba. During his stay there he had to devote his
attention to the Sienese affairs, which were of some consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to Florence. He had perceived the mistake once
committed in the Fortebracci affair, and thenceforward
strove to keep on good terms with the neighbouring commonwealth.
With regard to the frontier disputes, chiefly in
the Chiana valley, where the small places were always in a
state of feud one with the other, Florence showed herself
disposed for an amicable settlement. ‘God is my witness,’
wrote Lorenzo to the Signoria of Siena on February 28,
1484,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> ‘that my personal mediation and that of others was
little needed in the negotiations for the advantage of your
Republic, namely, in the matter of the frontiers; for the
whole city recognised, just as if acting in its own behalf, our
common interest in a close and friendly connection. As
the thing has been settled now with the agreement of all, so
also in future we shall not fail to give active proofs of our
sincere friendship.’</p>

<p>This friendship was soon put to the proof. The party
which had been defeated on the departure of the Duke of
Calabria from Siena could not forget the mortification. In
the beginning of April 1485, the Sienese ambassador at
Florence announced that a body of 2,000 men, under the
command of Giulio Orsini, was meditating an attack;
whereupon a considerable force under Ranuccio da Farnese
was despatched to the threatened ally.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> It was believed
that Perugia, Spoleto, and Todi served as places of meeting
for the discontented, and that the Cardinal della Rovere had
a hand in the undertaking. On May 4, Lorenzo wrote from
Bagno a Morba to Siena<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> that they must look to the security
of the frontiers. It was said that the Pope was inclined
to maintain peace, and had spoken to the ambassadors to
that effect. By the Florentines he had been urged to give
practical proof of his good intentions, and not to suffer his
dominions to be a harbour for designs against neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
States. ‘Your Lordships must know,’ he continues,
‘better than I who am at a distance, what is your internal
state and the mind of the citizens. If you are united, then,
in my opinion, you have nothing to fear: for Siena is not to
be taken with 2,000 men, and if the number of the aggressors
increases, you will also receive increased assistance. Of that
you need not doubt. Therefore, if there is among your
citizens the amount of concord and love which is reckoned
upon, your affairs will take a favourable course. I do not
believe that this movement of the exiles can count on much
support; for we hear from Lombardy that all the chief
powers are desirous of peace. Nevertheless it is your and
our duty to prepare for the worst and to have all available
means in readiness. Thereunto I desire to encourage your
Lordships, assuring you that we are of one mind with you,
as events will prove.’</p>

<p>A few days after this the exiles made a raid from
Umbria into the Arezzo territory and thence turned towards
the valley of the Arbia, where they attacked the castle of
San Quirico, on the Roman road, but were beaten back;
whereupon the troop dispersed. ‘The Signoria here,’ wrote
the Ferrarese ambassador, ‘is delighted at the news and in
good spirits. But the Sienese must be more delighted still;
now they must be convinced that the number of participators
is less than they suspected.’ On May 14, Lorenzo
wrote from Pisa to the Sienese Signoria that Florence regarded
their danger as her own; but he advised them to
look to their internal condition. ‘It would be best to prevent
the recurrence of such troubles by removing the occasion
of your distress and of reproach from others. It seems to
me time to come to a settlement of everything, provided that
the origin of all this evil is rooted out. If this is done the
past must not be too strictly inquired about. If such
attempts against your Lordships are continued you will not
want for protection, but the most effectual protection will
be good and just government and true unity.’ More than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
two years later, Lorenzo wrote on another occasion: ‘Your
Lordships know what has always been my conduct with
respect to attempts at revolution and dangers which have
befallen your citizens, and that I regard your welfare even
as that of our own commonwealth. This seems to me to
suit our friendly and neighbourly relations, as well as my
devotion to your Signoria.’ Both by word and deed Lorenzo
displayed his anxiety to maintain his political principle that
it was important for the Republic to make herself secure by
a good understanding with her neighbours, and to surround
herself with a circle of bulwarks by keeping friends with
Siena, Lucca, Bologna, Faenza, Perugia, and Città di Castello.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
He remained faithful to this principle, with a few
trifling exceptions, during the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>His other principle was to do all he could to prevent any
Italian state from gaining such an increase of importance
as to destroy the balance of power. In the summer of that
same year, 1485, a complication arose which threatened the
peace of Italy and put to the proof Lorenzo’s political skill.
It was a quarrel between Innocent VIII. and Ferrante of
Naples. The kingdom of Naples, the greatest territorial
power in Italy except Venice, was suffering from internal
evils which both in earlier and later times proved incurable,
and brought about the ruin of the fairest and richest portion
of the peninsula. The political parties were as old as the
monarchy; they were connected with deep-seated national
divergences; and their differences were heightened and
embittered by repeated conquests and changes of dynasty,
by the feudal connection with the Holy See&mdash;dating from
the time of the Normans&mdash;and by the passionate temper and
moral degradation that poisoned and corrupted all civil and
political relations in Southern Italy. The crown was completely
held in check by the higher nobility; it would have
been powerless had not the nobility been torn by factions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The split between the Aragonese and Angevin parties was
of very long standing. The times of the second and of the
first Joanna, the Sicilian Vespers, the French conquest,
were all steps of a ladder ascending up to the Hohenstaufen
Kaiser Henry VI. and the last of the Norman kings. The
wars were fresh in the memories of all. It was not much
more than twenty years since Ferrante had quelled the
dangerous rising, the calamitous consequences of which
never gave him any peace. His policy differed considerably
from that of his father. King Alfonso’s hand had borne
heavily on the party who had so long disputed his sovereignty
over Naples, but when peace was restored he not
only richly rewarded his own adherents, but tried to win
over to his side his opponents. His son had a deep distrust
of both parties, and his only aim was to increase the royal
power at the expense of feudalism.</p>

<p>Ferrante was not lacking in kingly qualities. He was
sagacious, skilful, energetic, and a good financier according
to the fiscal principles of the day&mdash;principles which of themselves
would have sufficed to kindle rebellion among the
nobles had political reasons been wanting. Numerous and
important improvements in all branches of administration
were due to him; increase of industry and commerce, great
works for the general good, constructions for the enlargement
and embellishment of the capital and other places,
which assumed quite a different appearance under him.
The disposition to promote the interests of science, art, and
education he inherited from his father; and under both
kings the Neapolitan Court, adorned by graceful and intellectual
women, took a prominent place among the many
Italian princely houses which distinguished themselves in
this respect. Alfonso of Calabria equalled, if he did not
surpass, his father in his love of literature and art. Ferrante
had some regard for the condition of his people: ‘It is our
will,’ he wrote, in November 1486, to the superintendent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
finances in Terra di Bari and Otranto,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> ‘that our subjects
shall receive good treatment at the hands of all our officers,
and that they may not have to complain of oppression and
undue burthens.’ Again, to the governor of Castrovillari,
an important place in Calabria, and one which had been in
the power of the enemies of the crown: ‘You are to treat
all well, and not suffer any to be oppressed on account of
the past. You are to bridle the passions which create discord
among the people, and to see that every one obeys the
laws.’ He formed a considerable military force, which
enabled him to take a fitting part in Italian affairs, and to
preserve peace for many years within his own dominions.</p>

<p>But Ferrante’s good qualities were overshadowed by
many bad ones. His illegitimate birth placed him from
childhood in a false position. As a boy he learned to master
his passions, and acquired a control over his words and
manner which too often degenerated into dissimulation to
secure his ends. Philippe de Commines (a contemporary somewhat
prejudiced, it is true, against the house of Aragon),
says, when speaking of Alfonso of Calabria, ‘The father
was more dangerous than the son, for nobody ever understood
either the man or his real thoughts. With an assumed
smiling manner he would deceive and betray people; there
was neither grace nor mercy in his disposition, as even his
relatives and adherents acknowledged; he knew neither
mercy nor pity for his poor people where money was concerned.’
In trying to promote trade and commerce he
thought first of the interests of his own exchequer, and
burdened the people with socages, requisitions, and duties
which too often defeated his own object. From the very
beginning of his reign he had to contend with difficulties
with his relatives, with his subjects, with the Popes, till his
natural distrustfulness had deepened into gloomy suspicion.
The remembrance of past (and by no means always justifiable)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
opposition and the dread of fresh outbreaks, increased
by the frequent threats on the part of foreign countries to
revive the claims of Anjou, led him astray to unjust and cruel
actions whereby he undermined the throne, to strengthen
which was his constant and never-ceasing aim. The feudal
arrangements of the kingdom not only weakened Ferrante’s
political power, but had the inconvenient consequence
of keeping him poor. It is difficult to believe that the ruler
of such a fertile country, though in great part uncultivated,
was in almost continual want of money, and was always
obtaining drafts on foreign, and especially Florentine, banks,
to which, in his turn, he had to give drafts on the current
revenues. He once asked Lorenzo for a loan of 10,000 gold
florins, which Lorenzo cut down to half; and Filippo Strozzi
advanced him 20,000 on one occasion, besides undertaking
the expense of provisioning the capital.</p>

<p>As Ferrante advanced in years his eldest son acquired a
baleful influence over him. Alfonso was by no means equal
to his father. He was considered a tolerably good soldier,
and was certainly not wanting in energy, nor apparently in
personal valour; yet he never carried out any campaign of
real importance, though the recapture of Otranto was looked
upon as a brilliant success. He was not lacking in cultivation
and interest in learning, but his bad qualities outweighed
his good ones. He was haughty, violent, faithless,
and cruel. He hated the barons of the kingdom from a
despot’s instinct, he hated the influential servants of his
father because their wealth excited his covetousness. As he
had not inherited Ferrante’s power of dissimulation, enough
was known of his sayings and projects to put others on their
guard, and his hatred was paid back in kind. He was not
more successful in making those beyond the kingdom favourably
disposed to him. The quarrel with Milan, of which,
however, the blame did not rest with him, was already
beginning, though it did not come to an open rupture till
after the death of his wife Ippolita. In Tuscany there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a secret grudge against him on account of the events of 1478&mdash;his
intrigues at Siena and the loss of Sarzana. He must
have known how unpopular he was at Florence, but he did
nothing to regain the favour of the government or the
people. ‘On October 8,’ observes Alamanno Rinuccini,
speaking of the year 1484,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> ‘the Duke of Calabria arrived in
Florence on his way back from Lombardy, where he had
been captain of the league against the Venetians. He was
accompanied by about eight hundred horsemen in bad condition.
On his entry he did not go to the palace to greet
the Signoria as he had hitherto done, though the Signoria
had made preparations to receive him, and summoned many
citizens for the purpose of honouring him. This was considered
a great piece of insolence. Nevertheless, in pursuance
of a shameful order, he was left unmolested during
his passage through our territory&mdash;to our shame, considering
what he had done five years before.’ Commines has drawn
in a few words a fearful picture of Alfonso: ‘Never,’ says
he, ‘was seen a more cruel, wicked, vicious, base man, or
one more addicted to excess.’ The Frenchman and the
courtier of Charles VIII. speaks here, but the portrait
drawn by the Venetian, Marino Sanuto, is not at all more
flattering.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>In the face of the Duke’s ill-will, now no longer doubtful,
aggravated by a suspicion of encroachments on the part of
the king, the most powerful of the Neapolitan barons had
entered upon a league for mutual protection, when the outbreak
of hostilities was precipitated by two distinct causes.
Ferrante and his son, however pleased they professed to be
at the election of Innocent VIII. as Pope, were in reality
anything but satisfied, as they feared to find him an adherent
of Anjou. The Duke had even made an effort to get him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
excluded from the list of candidates for the pontificate.
The embassy sent to Rome to present the congratulations of
Naples was to try to procure the remission of that everlasting
apple of discord, the feudal tribute. The Pope refused
to remit it, the king held to his resolve not to pay, and the
coming strife might be the more clearly foreshadowed as
Cardinal della Rovere was opposed to the Aragonese claims.
In the summer of 1485 the rupture took place. The Duke
of Calabria persuaded the king not to allow the schemes of
the discontented nobility to come to maturity, but to nip
them in the bud by a sudden attack. The way in which he
set to work furnished a new ground for heaping upon him
accusations of fraud and violence. On June 23, by treacherously
imprisoning the Count of Montorio, of the house of
Cantelmo, the chief person in Aquila, and his people, he
obtained possession of that city, which was an independent
commonwealth under the suzerainty of the crown; shortly
after, the same was done at Nola by arresting several of the
Orsini, to whom the countship belonged. Many of the heads
of the nobility were just then assembled at Melfi, in the
Basilicata, on the occasion of a wedding in the Caracciolo
family. In this manner a declaration of hostilities was
hastened, which, from the intensity of opposition, could
indeed hardly have been prevented under other circumstances,
but which was now encouraged by the disagreement
between the Pope and the king.</p>

<p>On August 10, 1485, the Duke of Calabria left Naples
to begin the war against the barons.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> He did not find them
unprepared; their vassals were in arms, and they had formed
an alliance with the Pope, who was angry, not only at the
refusal of the tribute, but also at the incredibly arbitrary
conduct of the king with regard to Church matters. This
monarch, nominally a vassal of Rome, not only subjected
the clergy to the most despotically imposed taxation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
treated the bestowal of ecclesiastical offices as a financial
speculation. Affairs soon became complicated. On September
26 the inhabitants of Aquila rose against their oppressors,
hewed the leader in pieces, set up the standard of the Church,
and sent plenipotentiaries to Rome. Ferrante tried to avert
the storm by sending his son, the Cardinal of Aragon, to
Rome; but he died on October 16. On the 17th Ferrante
caused a protest to be read in the cathedral of Naples,
announcing that he had no intention of making war against
the Pope. Next he tried to negotiate with the barons, sent
his son Don Federigo to the Sanseverini at Salerno, and
caused the Count of Montorio to be set at liberty. It was
all in vain; no one trusted him. The people of Salerno
kept the prince as a prisoner, and set up the standard of the
Church on November 20; the king’s own friends began to
desert him, one of his natural sons went over to the insurgents.
Ferrante had long been accustomed to put no trust
in his own relatives. This time the crisis was rendered
doubly serious by the now openly declared conduct of Innocent
VIII.</p>

<p>The new Pope’s desire to maintain peace and heal the
wounds inflicted during the late pontificate gave way at the
approach of the Neapolitan troubles, the point of contention
between the papal government and its neighbours. Innocent
can hardly have been drawn into the fight by the secret
motive of which he was accused&mdash;a preference for the interests
of his own family before the welfare and peace of the country;
but he may well have been influenced by his own and his
predecessor’s repeated unpleasant experience of the Aragonese.
He made the quarrel of Aquila and of the barons his
own, accepted their tender of obedience, and began to arm.
He had to be quick, not to give the Duke of Calabria time to
scatter his opponents. While the king sought help from
Florence and Milan, the Pope and the barons turned to
Venice. The propositions of the nobles were very tempting
to the Venetians, ever hankering after the cities on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Apulian coast; but they had doubts about entering upon
such a hazardous undertaking after all the losses they had
sustained in the last war. They expressed regret for the
oppression under which the barons described themselves as
suffering, but they recommended a compromise through the
mediation of the Pope; at the same time they dissuaded
Rome from violent proceedings. But when Innocent, hurried
on by the rapid progress of events, entered into negotiations
with Roberto da Sanseverino to obtain his services, they
contented themselves with half-measures. Roberto’s Venetian
<i>condotta</i> had expired at the peace of Bagnolo. The
Republic might easily have restrained his ardour, for though
his own people were deeply involved in the rising, the <i>condottiere</i>,
long a stranger to his own home, would have preferred
his own advantage to all other considerations. But
after a few indifferent remonstrances he was left free to go
‘according to his own pleasure,’ as was announced to the
Pope on October 7.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>How disagreeable all these matters were to the Florentines,
and above all to Lorenzo, may be imagined. A
dangerous flame was being kindled. Towards the end of
August the Neapolitan ambassador, Marino Tomacelli, made
to the Signoria, on behalf of the king, the first announcement
of the outbreak of internal hostilities, but without
owning their real importance. Before the middle of September
it became known that the Pope was causing troops to
march over the border. On October 3 the deliverance of
Aquila from the garrison placed there by the Duke of Calabria
became known. Thereupon Ferrante sent his eldest
son’s confidant&mdash;Giovanni Albino&mdash;to Lorenzo, who had
long been intimate with this learned and accomplished man,
at once a politician and a historian:<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> ‘You shall tell Lorenzo,’
such were Ferrante’s instructions,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> ‘that we turn to him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the best friend we have in Italy, and one for whom, in case
of need, we would risk our State, our children, and our own
person. Beg him not to leave us in the lurch; he and his
house shall be rewarded for their services to us.’ Then
followed negotiations with Lodovico il Moro, to whom
Albino proceeded on leaving Florence. It was ill speaking
of Lodovico at the latter city, because his intrigues with
Girolamo Riario kept up a constant fear of disturbances in
Romagna; nevertheless, in the present conjuncture, it was
necessary to try to keep at peace with him. The Duke of
Bari’s policy was evidently to put the Florentines forward
and watch the moment when he himself could most fittingly
appear. He proposed that the Florentines should hinder
Sanseverino’s passage through Umbria; but they answered
that it would be far simpler for <i>him</i> to prevent his crossing
the Po, whence he would doubtless skirt the Adriatic coast
and not turn inland at all. Next, Ercole d’Este gave
notice that by a brief of October 1 the Pope had commanded
him to grant a passage through the Duchy of Ferrara to
Roberto da Sanseverino, who was leading 600 men-at-arms
to his Holiness, and who, added the Duke, was expected to
set out on the 10th from Cittadella, in the Paduan territory,
cross the Po at Ficcarolo, and take the road through
Romagna and the Marches&mdash;which showed that the Florentines
were right in their answer to Sforza. Soon after news
came from Siena that the Pope had asked that Republic for
a body of 120 men-at-arms and 300 picked mercenaries.</p>

<p>The Florentines did all they could to prevent the Sienese
from yielding to the Pope’s demand. As the armed force of
Florence was small, they took the Count of Pitigliano into
their service and decided to await the course of events.
But there was no real feeling of security, from the impossibility
of trusting to the little neighbouring state. ‘The
Sienese,’ wrote the Ferrarese ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> ‘being by nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
at once frivolous and suspicious, and perpetually stirred up
by the Pope, are in a violent fever, lamenting over the
danger to which they would be exposed if the king got the
victory over the Pope, as he would then employ their natural
enemies&mdash;the Orsini&mdash;to avenge himself for the revolution
of 1480. Their ambassador plagued the illustrious Lorenzo
for two hours to-day with this nonsense, and it will cost a
great deal of trouble to keep them neutral, for they are
always getting troublesome.’ On October 10, the day on
which Sanseverino began his march, Lodovico il Moro wrote
to Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> He represented to him the danger that would
threaten the king if the enemy appeared on the frontiers of
the already excited country. ‘As your Magnificence sees,
prompt proceedings are necessary. The best way to help
the king will be to break at once with the Church, as the
Pope has done with the king. It appears to me necessary
that you should induce the Signoria to consent to a declaration
of war, that while awaiting reinforcements from hence
they may set their armed force in order and despatch it to
the frontier without minding the unfavourable season, which
hinders neither the Pope nor the lord Roberto. What the
foes think their troops capable of, ours can surely do. But
there is no time to be lost in coming to a decision.’</p>

<p>When this new complication arose, Lorenzo was at the
baths of San Filippo in the Siena territory. The Morba
waters had greatly benefited him in the spring, and in May
the Anziani of Siena sent a special envoy to congratulate
him on his recovery;<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> but it was not lasting. The position
of affairs was such as to embarrass even as practised a politician
as Lorenzo. He thought it needful to support the
king, but he was too clear-sighted and knew his native city
too well to give way to illusions as to the feeling about
Naples. The king and the duke were hated; to enter on
their behalf into a war, which would entail certainly great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
expenses and possibly serious complications, was pleasing to
no one. When Lorenzo proposed to the Council to give
support to Ferrante of Naples he met with vehement opposition.
‘At first,’ relates Niccolò Valori,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> ‘the majority
were decidedly against the proposal. In the midst of this
long-wished-for peace, said they, did he want to kindle the
flame of a fresh war? Had he forgotten in what danger they
had been placed by arms and the censures of the Pope?
What if Venice should take part in the contest? How were
they to help the king, hard-pressed at once by internal feuds
and external war? Let him beware of turning aside the
war from Ferrante, and drawing it upon his own home. Notwithstanding,
Lorenzo urged the necessity of taking a side
with so much eloquence that those who doubted were encouraged,
and at last all were brought over to his view. I
never read anything more earnest and impressive or better
put together than this speech, which was taken down at the
time.’ But while Lorenzo held it a political necessity to
side with Naples, he clearly perceived the reason of this
fresh disturbance of peace. The bad condition of the
Neapolitan finances and army was no secret from him. ‘I
regret,’ he wrote on November 3 to Albino,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> after informing
him of the proposals made by the insurgents in case of the
neutrality of Florence, ‘that the king is no longer reputed
to have a rich treasury and a good army as of old, when he
was regarded as the arbiter of Italy. That the contrary is
now the case I regret on account of my devotion to his
Majesty; but, however matters may stand, I shall always
fulfil my obligations. I am most deeply grieved that my
lord the duke is denounced as cruel; though it be a false
accusation, yet his Excellency should do all in his power to
rid himself of it, for it can only be to his advantage to do
so. If the taxes are hateful to the people let them be
abolished, and let the former contributions suffice; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
carlino willingly and gladly paid is better than ten gained
by compulsion and with ill-will; for no people willingly
endures the imposition of fresh burthens.’ He also recommended
keeping the soldiers in good humour; never had
this been more needed. If the king had faith in himself he
would conquer; the Signoria would be true to him. Ferrante
thanked Lorenzo for his wise counsels, but remarked that he
did not altogether understand them.</p>

<p class="pch">REACTION AFTER THE BARONS’ WAR. THE STRUGGLE FOR
SARZANA.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Lorenzo’s</span> position was anything but enviable. The Florentine
merchants at Naples complained that the Duke of
Calabria did not fulfil his obligations, and, moreover, treated
them insolently, so that they found themselves compelled to
leave the city.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The Pope, who on November 1, 1485, had
issued a bull enumerating all the charges of the Holy See
against the King of Naples, and threatening with excommunication
all who should support the latter, exerted himself
to prevent the Republic from taking part in the quarrel.
The authority of the Medici even might receive a blow, for
the position of affairs in the kingdom was considered bad in
the extreme. Lorenzo was visibly full of cares. He proceeded
very slowly. Towards the end of November Innocent
sent the Archbishop of Florence to his cathedral city to
try if he could change the mind of his brother-in-law.
Rinaldo Orsini was a prelate of a type then but too common;
from his youth up he had held benefices without spiritual
functions, and so he treated his archbishopric as a sort of
garrison, the revenue of which was sufficient for him. He
was generally in Rome; leaving his vicar to look after the
church affairs. Being in the habit of getting into debt, he
afterwards tried to do a profitable piece of business with his
see. At last, when things in Florence were altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
changed, and the powerful support of the Medici failed him,
the universal dissatisfaction reduced him to resign for a
pension and a title <i>in partibus</i>. Before this, during the persecutions
that broke out against his family in the time of
the Borgias, his insignificance as a mere man of pleasure
had saved him from the tragic fate of his cousin Cardinal
Orsini, with whom he had been placed in the castle of St.
Angelo. It may easily be imagined that he was not the man
to make any impression on Lorenzo, more especially as the
latter well knew that he was entirely a creature of the Pope,
in daily anticipation of obtaining the cardinal’s hat. Rinaldo
declared that Innocent was determined on war. For months
past he had been warning the king, through the now deceased
Cardinal of Aragon, through his brother Don Francesco,
even through the Florentine ambassador; but Ferrante
only went on more recklessly, and now at last allowed things
to take their own course.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, November 10, Sanseverino arrived at Rome,
and was solemnly received at the Porta del Popolo by the
governor of the city, the papal court, the ambassadors of the
Kaiser and of King Maximilian, and others. Twenty days
after, in the Vatican basilica, he took the oath to the Pope as
gonfalonier of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Innocent showed to the Florentine
ambassador money and jewels to the value of 150,000
ducats, all of which, he said, was to be spent in carrying
out the war. All recruiting and sales of horses in and
around Rome, except for the service of the Church, were forbidden.
But in Naples it was resolved not to await the
attack. Alfonso of Calabria marched into the States of the
Church, and was soon on the nearer side of the Alban hills,
with the Campagna and the city lying before him; on the
north-west the Orsini were taking up arms in alliance with
him; Florentine troops were advancing under the Counts of
Pitigliano and Marsciano and the lord of Piombino, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
100 Milanese men-at-arms under the Count of Cajazzo&mdash;for
that was all Lodovico sent after all his assurances! Soon
the Neapolitans and the Papal troops attacked each other in
the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, by the bridges over
the Anio. The whole city was in tumult. Monte Giordano,
the Orsini stronghold in the Campus Martius, was burnt
down; King Ferrante’s ambassador, who with his colleagues
of Florence and Milan had remained in Rome after the
fighting began, had his house plundered and wrecked, and
fled to the Vatican. The greatest distress and insecurity
prevailed; cardinals and others brought their valuables to
the Pope’s palace and to the castle of St. Angelo for safety.
But the duke proved himself a wretched general. He could
not manage to effect a junction with the Orsini, and Sanseverino
pressed the latter hard, compelled some of them to
accept a compromise, and obstructed the road into Tuscany.
Within the kingdom itself matters were taking an unfavourable
turn; Alfonso, seeing himself in danger of being
hemmed in within the Campagna, decided to make a diversion
against the Pope and gain breathing-time for himself
by coming to a personal understanding with Lorenzo and
Lodovico. On January 17, 1486, the news reached Florence
that the heir to the Neapolitan throne had left the army in
a dangerous position, and with only 300 horsemen taken the
road through the lower part of the Viterbo territory. After
riding sixty miles a day, like a fugitive, he arrived at Pitigliano,
the little capital of the Orsini territory, on the west
of the lake of Bolsena; from thence he intended proceeding
to Florence and Milan.</p>

<p>The surprise in Florence was great. Negotiations had
never ceased between the Pope and Lorenzo. It was said
that the latter was trying to facilitate an accommodation;
but there was a suspicion that he was playing a double
game, that he had no confidence in the Neapolitan affairs, and
that he had a hand in the defection of some of the Orsini,
which put the Duke of Calabria into difficulties; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
now he wanted to hinder the Duke coming to Florence, in
order to escape his reproaches. The Signoria immediately
sent a special messenger to the Duke to prevent his coming
to the city; Piero Capponi followed the messenger, to have
an explanation with Alfonso, and to remain with the army
as Florentine commissioner.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> For some time past Lorenzo
had been suffering severely; an affection of the bladder was
now added to his old complaint the gout. He was not in a
happy humour. He said he would have nothing more to do
with business, for everything was going contrary to his
desires and expectations; he meant to spend his time more
agreeably. He begged Ercole d’Este and the Marquis of
Mantua to send him falcons, and it was said that he was
going to Pisa for change of air. His ill humour was visible.
Sometimes he was in the city, sometimes at Careggi. The
Duke of Calabria was urgent to see him at Pitigliano, in
Florence, anywhere he liked; but he was not to be persuaded.
Pier Filippo Pandolfini and Giovanni Serristori went in
January to Pitigliano to agree upon the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the situation had somewhat improved. The
troops, deserted by the Duke whom all accused of cowardice
and want of head, were guided by Paolo Orsini to Vicovaro
in the valley of the Anio, beyond Tivoli; from thence the road
into the kingdom was open to them. Gentile Virginio and
others of the Orsini remained faithful. Letters from Milan
announced an intention of abiding by this alliance. On
February 3, Gian Jacopo Trivulzio and Marsilio Torello
arrived in Florence with men-at-arms and archers, to join
the Duke.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The latter came as far as Montepulciano, and
wanted to make an attempt upon Perugia, where there was
some understanding with a few of the Baglioni. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Florentines had no desire to see the fire kindled so near
their own borders; and as the Milanese were of the same
mind, the plan was given up. The war was again transferred
to the Papal territory, where the union between the
Orsini and the duke was at last effected. But it was a feeble
war, which only served to display the decay of Italian
military skill. One single fight, however, in which the allies
were victorious, and which took place in the beginning of
May near Campagnano, a place belonging to the Orsini and
situated twenty-one miles north-west of Rome, deserves the
name of a warlike achievement. The Florentine commissioner,
who was not a military man, but had seen a good
deal of fighting in his life, was very little edified by the proceedings.
On the papal side they were no better off. Innocent,
ill and repeatedly in danger of his life, saw his means
disappearing, his capital disturbed and discontented, almost
besieged, and the neighbourhood devastated. He had little
confidence in Sanseverino, who failed to profit by the favourable
moment of the Duke’s absence, and whose chief aim
seemed to be to gain a red hat for one of his sons. This
distrust was heightened by letters from Piero Capponi, which,
by a not over-honourable artifice, raised doubts as to Sanseverino’s
honesty, and were put into the enemy’s hands.
Through the Bishop of Treviso the Pope tried to get help
from Venice; through the Cardinal della Rovere, who went
to Genoa at the end of March, he set on foot a negotiation
with the Duke of Lorraine, who with the help of France
was planning an expedition against Naples. But everything
remained too long in suspense.</p>

<p>In the College of Cardinals the different opinions produced
violent disputes. As has been observed, Lorenzo remained
in communication with Innocent, although he was
the very corner-stone of the league in favour of Naples, and
without Florentine money the king would long ago have been
unable to carry on the war. It was his representations that
chiefly contributed to induce the Pope to arrive at the needful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
accommodation. Ferrante on his part saw very well that
unless he made peace abroad it was vain to think of restoring
peace at home. Lodovico il Moro, though now less scanty
in his contributions of assistance, was still more lavish of
words than of deeds. His brother Ascanio was urging the Pope
to an accommodation. On March 6 he spoke very strongly
in the secret consistory in opposition to Cardinal La Balue,
who was charged by France with supporting the interests of
the Duke of Lorraine. The Pope, said Sforza, had a right
to claim from King Ferrante the fulfilment of his obligations
to the Church; but it was contrary to the duty of a cardinal
to try and induce the Pope to drive the king from his hereditary
throne and put a stranger in his place. He, Sforza,
believed that he was not failing in his duty to the holy
father in defending the rights of his relative. The cardinal
of Erlau, the pious Franciscan Gabriel Rangoni, supported
Ascanio, and said to the Pope: ‘Your Holiness has
threatened to go as far as the Acheron. If the war continues,
I fear those words will come true. May your wisdom
find means to prevent greater troubles!’<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The Florentines were wearied with the whole affair.
Ambassadors came from René of Lorraine to argue against
the alliance with Naples, and to recall the old relations with
France, and the old devotion of Florence to the Holy See.
They were answered that the league which had existed for
some time between the Republic, Naples, and Milan had for
its object the preservation of peace; the disturbance had
come from the Pope. The latter had never mentioned the
Duke of Lorraine in his negotiations with the city; and if
he was now making use of his name to help his own cause,
they must first of all find out his real aims, and then consult
with the allies. The old obligations to France would be remembered
as far as was consistent with honour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
answer, remarks Francesco Guicciardini,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> was prudent, for
ambassadors had arrived not only from the duke but also
from the King of France, and for the sake of the merchants
it was necessary to be cautious. The occurrence caused a
good deal of anxiety, so that Lorenzo, who well knew the
attachment of the citizens to the house of France and their
hatred to King Ferrante, was afraid of the burthen becoming
too heavy for his shoulders, particularly as the alliance with
Ferrante was displeasing to many of the chief citizens. He
would, perhaps, have changed his policy, although Venice,
where his brother-in-law Bernardo Rucellai was ambassador,
and which did not like seeing foreigners in Italy, now sided
with the king; but suddenly peace put an end to all
troubles.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 11, 1486, this peace was
signed at Rome by the Spanish ambassador, the Count of
Tendilla, the Archbishop of Milan, and Gian Jacopo Trivulzio
on behalf of Sforza, Cardinal Giovanni Michiel on behalf of
the Pope, and Gioviano Pontano on behalf of Naples. King
Ferrante was again formally to acknowledge the supremacy
of the Church; to pay the tribute; to retain Aquila on condition
of maintaining its liberties; not to oppress the barons
who returned to their allegiance, and to give them complete
freedom as to their abode and their family connections.
These conditions were to be guaranteed by Milan and Florence.
The Orsini were to beg the Pope’s forgiveness, and
to be taken back into favour under guarantee of the said
States; all places taken on either side were to be restored.
Sanseverino was dismissed from the service of the Church.
In Florence the conclusion of peace was celebrated by ringing
the bells; but Lorenzo was highly displeased, not at the
peace as such, but at the manner and the conditions of it,
on which he spoke sharply to the Milanese ambassador.
The conclusion had been arrived at without reference to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and there had been no mention of Sarzana. In reality this
was better than what had been originally intended, for
Cardinal Sforza had exerted himself to get his brother Lodovico
appointed arbiter in the question; but this scheme
was foiled by the decided opposition of Capponi, who was
then at Bracciano.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The Republic had spent all her money
for a cause not her own.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> And what a peace it was! Sanseverino
had most decidedly not proved himself a hero in
the war, and his conduct had not deserved any great confidence.
But the way in which he was treated was almost
past belief. The gonfalonier of the Church, who as holder
of one of the highest dignities had handed the holy water to
the Pope at a solemn mass a little while before, suddenly
found himself like an outlaw chieftain compelled to use force
against force. He was told he might go where he liked, and
a claim which he sent in for arrears of pay was left unnoticed.
Then, when he was about to take the road to
Romagna, to return to the Venetian territory, he found himself
surrounded by Neapolitan troops. To fight was certain
ruin. He had nothing for it but to dissolve his bands; many
escaped to the Marches; others were taken, plundered,
slain; others again took service with the Duke of Calabria.
With about a hundred horsemen Roberto cut his way through,
and after many difficulties arrived as a fugitive, on the Venetian
frontier which less than a year before he had crossed
at the head of a powerful army. The Republic took him
back into her service, and he showed himself not ungrateful
and far less selfish than was the usual fashion of <i>condottieri</i>.
A year after the conclusion of a peace so fatal to him, he
met his death fighting gallantly in the neighbourhood of
Roveredo, in the war stirred up by the frontier disputes
between Venice and Archduke Sigismund of Austria-Tyrol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
The Sanseverino affair, however, disappeared before what
happened in Naples.</p>

<p>Two days after the conclusion of the treaty, at Castelnuovo,
on the occasion of a marriage arranged by the king
between Marco Coppola, son of the Count of Sarno, chief
counsellor of the crown, and a daughter of Antonio Piccolomini
Duke of Amalfi, granddaughter of Ferrante, the count
and his family were arrested, as well as Antonello Petrucci
the other private secretary of the king, the Count of Burello,
formerly ambassador to Rome, and many of their relatives
and friends, all distinguished and influential persons. They
had been in communication with the insurgent barons,
and as far back as October of the previous year Lodovico il
Moro had given the king proofs of their guilt; but the latter
had secured them and then waited till the conclusion of
peace to draw in the net. Only a fortnight before he had
called the Count of Sarno ‘our best-beloved counsellor.’
Three months later the culprits were condemned to death
and executed; and the shuddering city beheld the bleeding
limbs of the Count of Carinola, son of Antonello Petrucci,
quartered by the executioner’s hand. All their property
was confiscated; not only were their possessions within the
country sequestrated, but Ferrante at once sent one of the
superior officers of the chamber of accounts to take possession
of sums deposited in the banks in Rome, Florence, Genoa,
and Milan. A million in gold is said to have thus passed
into his hands. Horrified at this fearful vengeance, warned
by the fate of Aquila, which lost all its liberties, and putting
no trust in the stipulated guarantee of Florence and Milan,
the barons were long undecided if they should trust themselves
to the mercy of the king. Ferrante himself did not
believe they would. At last, however, they submitted, besought
pardon, and promised fidelity and obedience. ‘All
the princes and lords who formerly rebelled against us,’
wrote the king on February 17, 1487, to Giovanni Nauclero,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his ambassador to Ferdinand the Catholic, ‘are now with us
at Naples. They enjoy greater security for their persons
and possessions, and greater contentment and tranquillity
than before the war; for they have their revenues as heretofore,
and while we know that we are safe with them
because their castles are in our hands, they are safe with us,
and, thank God, we live together without suspicion. The
past has vanished from our memory, and we treat them as
dear sons. We hope it will last, for we are resolved to give
them daily greater occasion to remain in this mind. Thus
we keep all parts of our kingdom in peace and quiet.’
Within three months came the confiscation of the principality
of Salerno, whose lord&mdash;Antonello da Sanseverino&mdash;was
absent from the country; and, later on, the arrest of
those ‘dear sons’ the barons, who one after another disappeared
and left no trace behind.</p>

<p>The complications which arose from this interpretation
of the conditions of peace between the king and the Pope,
and the sentiments it awakened in Florence, will be mentioned
later on. There can be little difference of opinion as to
this melancholy episode and its influence on the destinies of
Naples. But the whole blame must not be laid on Ferrante.
A nobility so powerful and warlike, so rebellious, and among
some of whom disaffection was an inheritance, rendered
government impossible. Defection had penetrated the king’s
own privy council, nay even his own family. How little
unity there was in the latter is shown by the fact that the
barons hoped and attempted to gain over to their side Don
Federigo, who was as much beloved as his brother Alfonso
was hated and feared. At Salerno they offered him the
crown, which he refused. Ferrante conquered by prudence
and force of arms, but he abused his victory by cunning,
avarice, and cruelty. In the use of foul means he outdid
his old enemy Louis XI.; but while the latter, who personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was not a bit better, strengthened the royal power,
Ferrante overshot the mark and cut the ground from under
his own feet. Other men of the time were not more honest,
yet they never enacted such horrible tragedies as those witnessed
at Naples in 1486 and 1487. Ferrante’s reign lasted
seven years longer, externally more quiet than before, more
prosperous, more unlimited, less disturbed; but all his
sagacity could not save him from the phantoms called up by
the consciousness of past crimes and the fear of new dangers.
In his strivings after despotic power, and in the interests of
the latter, he made havoc of the old nobility. He could not
destroy it so completely as to prevent its remaining one of
the factors in all great political changes, or the enmity of a
large portion of it from becoming fatal to his house, but he
diminished the strength of the country, which was founded
on the old feudal order of things. He hoped to find support
from the people, but could not really raise them because his
system of monopolies and finance oppressed them no less
than the outgrowths of the feudal state, and he had not
time to carry out the change in public matters which he
might possibly have projected. The people, who had not
forgotten old grievances, were bound by no ties of affection
to their sovereign and his heir-apparent, who had come out
of the Barons’ war with a greatly diminished reputation for
military capacity and a yet more greatly increased reputation
for faithlessness and cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Like the peace of 1484, that of 1486 did not take into
consideration the Florentine desires and demands in the
vexed question of Sarzana.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was ill and out of humour. Repeated attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of gout either laid him up at home, as in July 1486, or compelled
him to go to Bagno a Morba, where he passed the
September of the same year. He often sojourned at Careggi
for a time or at the villa at Poggio a Cajano, where he
sought refreshment and relaxation from the exciting affairs
which never left him free. He was at no pains to conceal
his irritation. One ally compromised him by faithlessness
and severity, the other endangered his policy by double-dealing
and the pursuit of selfish aims. The more lavish
were the assurances of friendship, the nearer treachery was
lurking. As to the treaty of peace and Trivulzio’s part in
it, he declared the proceedings of Milan were downright
disgraceful. When Ferrante began to meddle with the
barons whose safety had been guaranteed by Florence and
Milan, and it became evident that he aimed at their destruction
and the confiscation of their property, Lorenzo remarked
that from a political point of view the king was becoming
too powerful. If he went on thus he would soon be master
in Italy, in which case Florence and Milan would fare badly,
as the predominance of his influence had repeatedly been
injurious to them. From the Duke of Calabria the worst
must be expected, as he was of a malicious and vindictive
temper setting aside that, when once his object was attained
he regarded neither friendship nor past services. Lorenzo
saw that he must bring the Sarzana affair to a conclusion if
he did not wish to endanger his own position. The thing
could not be done in the year which ended the Barons’ war,
but the next must not be allowed to pass without profit.
There was not much to be expected from the allies. King
Ferrante well knew how much he was indebted to Lorenzo
and to Florence, and remarked that one good turn deserved
another; but added that where an alliance was so sure and
the will so entirely the same on both sides, conduct must be
measured, not by the extent of the obligation, but by the
power to serve. Then came the usual references to the
exhaustion of the treasury, difficulties with the Pope, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the danger from the Turks, all of which Bernardo Rucellai,
the ambassador at Naples, likewise had to listen to.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> To
Lutozzo Nasi, another Florentine diplomatist, Ferrante said:
‘Lorenzo knows that I really love him and his city, for I
have had practical proof of his attachment to me and mine.
But for him, they and I would no longer be in this kingdom.
He has conferred on us a benefit which we and our posterity
never will or can forget, and we will always display our
gratitude to him and the Signoria.’ But all this was mere
talk. It was not of much use that Ferrante occasionally
condescended to flatter the Signoria, as, for instance, when
in the autumn of 1486 he appointed a house in Naples
for their embassy, as King Ladislaus had once done for
Venice; or when he sent back trophies of the war of 1478,
declaring that he did not wish to preserve memorials of past
strife when nothing should be thought of but reciprocal
friendship.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>In Lodovico il Moro Lorenzo had still less confidence,
but on account of the situation in Northern Italy, and especially
on account of the Venetians, he was yet more anxious
to keep on the best terms possible with Milan. Lodovico
was jealous of the close relations between his allies; so, in
order not to increase this jealousy, Lorenzo found it convenient
to point out the common interest of Florence and
Milan in preventing the king from becoming too powerful.
Moreover, the Sarzana affair still prevented the conclusion
of a good understanding. Lodovico was always thinking of
regaining Genoa, and was the more unwilling to turn the
Genoese against him for the sake of a quarrel which kept
them in continual suspense, because they had applied to
Venice herself for aid against the Florentines. Innocent VIII.
had made an attempt at mediation, whereby the Bank of
San Giorgio was to give up Pietrasanta and receive Sarzana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in exchange; but the matter fell through, nominally on
account of disagreements between the Pope and his native
city, but no doubt also because, after all the sacrifices that
had been made, public opinion in Florence would have been
in nowise satisfied with such a settlement. A trifling occasion,
the occupation by the Florentines of a small castle
beyond the Magra, sufficed to cause high words between
Lorenzo and Lodovico. The former had sent Baccio Ugolini
to the Duke of Calabria in 1486, and Sforza took it
amiss that he had not been informed of the fact. ‘Milan
and Lord Lodovico,’ returned Lorenzo, ‘seem to forget that
this city calls herself a city of freedom, and that she would
be in a sorry plight if she could not even send a man on an
unofficial mission to the Neapolitan prince without taking
advice from Milan about it.’ In Florence, he continued,
nothing had been said when Lord Lodovico, without asking
anybody’s opinion, made his agreement with Venice. Such
things were tokens of disaffection, and should it ever befall
that Milan was in need of Florence it would be impossible
to incline the people in her favour if they had been previously
driven to extremities. Such were the relations in
which these Italian States, calling themselves allies, stood
to each other! Then fine words followed again, and assurances
of friendship, which kept up appearances and deceived
nobody as to the real state of the case. To Lorenzo’s honour
it must be said that he did all in his power to support the
tottering edifice of concord.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1487 the Florentines were firmly
resolved to make an end of the Sarzana affair, which was
really becoming a disgrace to the Republic. But the Genoese
were beforehand with them. On a hill to the east of the
town of Sarzana lies the fort of Sarzanello, begun by the
brave Ghibelin leader Castruccio Castracani when he extended
the Lucchese territory as far as the Magra. It was
a hill-fort, still worthy of notice for its construction, and it
had always been held by the Florentines. In March 1487<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the commandant of Sarzana, Gian Luigi Fiesco of Lavagna,
made a sudden attack on Sarzanello, took the outworks, and
began to fire on the fortress. The famous Sienese architect
Francesco di Giorgio, who, together with Giuliano da Sangallo,
did more than anyone else for the military architecture
of the time, was serving as an engineer in the Genoese camp,
and he seems to have first adopted the mining system against
Sarzanello. Florence saw there was no time to lose. The
Count of Pitigliano and the lords of Piombino, Faenza, and
Mirandola commanded the troops, to which Naples and
Milan sent scanty contingents. On April 15 the besiegers
of the fort were completely beaten, and their leader, Obietto
Fiesco, fell into the hands of the victors. But the fight for
the town of Sarzana dragged on, though the troops were
better than some of their leaders. The place was in increasing
misery, yet the defenders held out amid the distress
and ruin of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June Lorenzo went to Pisa to be
nearer the scene of action. On the 8th he was in the camp
and ordered the town to be more closely surrounded. An
attempt to relieve it failed. On the 21st it was decided to
storm it, but a white flag was hoisted on the walls, and the
next morning the gates were opened. The inhabitants were
spared, the garrison remained prisoners of war. Two days
before midsummer Lorenzo returned to Florence. ‘Never,’
writes the Ferrarese ambassador, ‘was he received with such
acclamations by the people, who attribute the recapture of
Sarzana to him before all others.’<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> It was not the importance
of the place itself that Florence cared for; she regarded
its seizure as an insult. ‘After you have saluted in our
name the illustrious Signoria, my lords the Eight, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
illustrious lord Lorenzo,’ thus ran Ferrante’s instructions<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
of July 27 to Antonio Sperandeo, whom he was sending to
Florence, ‘you shall express to them our joy at the recovery
of Sarzana; a joy which beseems true and sincere friends on
such a happy occasion, and is meet for a connection which
makes the advantage and welfare of the one the advantage
and welfare of the other. Therefore we rejoice at the conclusion
of this affair as at a piece of good fortune to ourselves,
and pray God that He may further the interests and
well-being of us both, and lead us from good to better
through a continuance of our reciprocal friendship.’ How
much of these assurances of friendship should be laid to the
account of the complications at home, may be left undecided.</p>

<p>Lodovico il Moro took no trouble to hide his ill-humour,
and immediately recalled his troops from the Florentine
camp on the Magra, whereat the Florentines were highly
indignant. Lorenzo said he supposed the Duke of Bari
thought Genoa and the Castelletto would be given up to
him next. But it actually came to pass. The Cardinal-Doge,
Paolo Fregoso, perceived that he could not hold his
ground amidst his many enemies, even if the Florentines&mdash;as
they were certainly disposed to do&mdash;did not advance
further towards the Riviera, where the neighbourhood of the
gulf of Spezia was almost unprotected. While he began
negotiating with Sforza the Adorni party were negotiating
with France. Lodovico was quicker than the counsellors of
the young king, and, after much debating in one form and
another, the matter ended in Genoa once more acknowledging
the Duke of Milan as her superior; whereupon the
doge was pensioned and went to end his much-disturbed
days at Rome. The Florentines were not destined long to
enjoy the possession of Sarzana, which had cost them so
much blood and still more money. During Charles VIII.’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
campaign against Naples, both the town and the fortress
passed into the hands of the French, who, when Florentine
troops and commissioners came to demand their restoration,
sold them to that same bank of San Giorgio with which the
Republic had fought so long for their possession.</p>

<p class="pch">LORENZO AS MEDIATOR BETWEEN ROME AND NAPLES.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time past there could have been no question as
to Lorenzo’s earnest desire to arrive at a good understanding
with Innocent VIII. Immediately after the latter’s election
circumstances appeared favourable, and the Florentines had
reasonable hopes of putting an end to the contest for Sarzana.
Unfortunately, the dispute between the Pope and the
King of Naples interfered to retard the good understanding,
but, though Florence took the king’s side, no declarations of
war were published, and the negotiations with the Pope
were never broken off. Lorenzo always remained in communication
with Innocent. It was through him that at the
peace of 1486, the Orsini, who were left unprotected, were
reconciled with the Pope. He attached great importance
to the latter’s friendship on both public and private grounds.
He fully understood the instability of the Italian league
and the extent of the influence of the States of the Church
on those at home. With regard to family affairs he had to
take into consideration not only money matters relative to
an advantageous marriage for his eldest son and his daughters,
who were now growing up, but also of preferment for
his second son, who, by his father’s wish, was early to enter
on the career once designed for his uncle. All these various
interests were fully developed in Lorenzo’s conduct during
the year 1487.</p>

<p>In April 1486 a distinguished and warlike citizen of
Osimo in the Marches of Ancona, by name Boccalino de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>’
Guzzoni, having acquired great influence over the people,
profited by the Pope’s hour of difficulty to take forcible
possession of that town, which, like many other Papal possessions,
was somewhat inclined to be rebellious. He pleaded
in extenuation of his proceedings that there was a certain
sum owing to him from the Apostolic Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Lodovico
immediately remarked that if the man was inclined to join
the league against the Pope he should have help, as the
matter had fallen out very seasonably.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> But Boccalino had
no intention of accepting the foreign aid, which he would
not trust, without first trying his own powers. The peace
between Naples and the Pope at first turned to his advantage,
as many of Sanseverino’s dispersed soldiers entered his
service; but he very soon saw that he was lost, and, yielding
to the remonstrances addressed to him in the name of
the young Duke of Urbino, he came to terms with the Pope.
The accommodation, however, did not last long; Boccalino
again set up the standard of revolt, whereupon it was
decided to besiege Osimo. Boccalino then conceived the
adventurous idea of applying to Constantinople and stirring
up Sultan Bajazet to an attack on the Marches, which he
himself would administer as a vassal of the Turkish empire.
The messenger who was to carry this proposition, a nephew
of Boccalino, was arrested at Lecce, and the letters fell into
King Ferrante’s hands. He disclosed the story to Trivulzio,
who had been in the kingdom with Milanese troops ever
since the Barons’ war, and to the ambassadors of Florence
and Milan, through whom it reached the ears of the Pope.
Rome determined to prevent the rebellion from spreading
further. On March 2, Cardinal della Rovere was appointed
legate for the Marches,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and Giulio Cesare Varano, lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Camerino, commander of the troops. Both proceeded to
Osimo, but failed in their object, for Boccalino managed to
blind the cardinal with the eloquence of his speech; so the
Pope addressed Lodovico il Moro with a request that he
would lend him Trivulzio and some of his troops. The
Duke of Bari acceded to the request; on May 8, Gian
Jacopo reached Rome, and on the 31st he was in the camp
before Osimo.</p>

<p>For a long time this gallant soldier accomplished
nothing; he lacked money, artillery, and ammunition.
Part of the Milanese troops deserted and left the camp
because their pay was in arrears; the papal contingent was
quite useless; Boccalino kept on negotiating with the cardinal
and with Francesco Gaddi, whom Lorenzo, through
the Bishop of Arezzo, had sent to arrange an accommodation
with Boccalino.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> At last Rome grew weary. Cardinal
La Balue, the deep intriguer who had reason to congratulate
himself that Louis XI. had done no worse than shut him up
in an iron cage, but who was not wanting in capacity and
had gained some influence at the papal court, was sent in
the latter half of June, with money and fresh troops, to
relieve Della Rovere. When he arrived, Trivulzio had fortified
a height which overhung the town, and had thus rendered
further resistance impossible. On July 12 the inhabitants
offered to capitulate. The Florentine envoy helped
to arrange the terms: Boccalino agreed, on payment of 8,000
ducats, to leave the town and settle at Florence. ‘This
evening,’ wrote Trivulzio to Milan on August 1, ‘I have
caused 200 foot soldiers and a squadron of men-at-arms to
march into Osimo. Early to-morrow morning Messer Boccalino
will leave the city, and then my lord the legate will hold
his solemn entry. The matter could not have been more
happily or honourably settled.’ More happily or honourably!
For sixteen months a town by no means strong had held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
out in rebellion against the lord of the land, and after a five
months’ siege it had surrendered for money and pardon.
It was fortunate for the inhabitants, but it showed the
deplorable condition of military affairs.</p>

<p>Boccalino de’ Guzzoni betook himself to Florence, where
he was honourably received, and Lorenzo was commissioned
to pay him the greater part of the sum allotted to him, of
which he had received 1,000 ducats on his departure. But
there were other difficulties to contend with, and Lorenzo’s
letters to Giovanni Lanfredini, the ambassador at Rome,
show how indignant he was at the delay in fulfilling the
promises made him from thence, and how he feared to be
compromised by this delay. As the promised money did
not arrive and Boccalino pressed for payment, Lorenzo advanced
him 500 ducats and charged the ambassador to see
to the settlement of the matter. ‘I do not believe,’ he
wrote to Lanfredini,’<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> that the Pope is by nature spiteful or
quarrelsome. But even if he were so, which I have never
observed, he ought not to be so towards me. Try to arrange
the matter, for I should regret the least stain on my honour
more than life or all else that is dear to me on earth. Make
no secret of it that, if no regard is paid to my honour, I
shall make no scruple of showing my displeasure. I cannot
believe it, but shall act according to experience.’ The
Florentines seemed to expect that Boccalino would settle
among them and claim the freedom of the city, in which
they were willing to help him; they also offered him a
military post in their service. After staying awhile, however,
he went to Milan, whence Lodovico, who disliked
having him in his neighbourhood, got rid of him by force.</p>

<p>When Lorenzo performed this service for the Pope, a
family alliance had already been sealed between them. The
course of political events has caused us to lose sight of the<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>mi pare mettere una gran parte dello honore e fede mia.’<br />
Medici family since the complications and conflicts which
sprang from the Pazzi conspiracy. The house in the Via
Larga was full of children; besides the three sons, Piero,
Giovanni, and Giuliano, there were four blooming daughters,
Lucrezia, Maddalena, Luigia, and Contessina. Lucrezia,
the eldest of all, was early betrothed to Jacopo Salviati, for
the sake of blotting out the memories of 1478. Luigia, the
third daughter, was the bride of Giovanni de’ Medici, the
younger grandson of Cosimo the Elder’s brother Lorenzo.
When the eldest daughter’s marriage took place in 1487,
her grandmother was dead. Lucrezia Tornabuoni died on
the Feast of the Annunciation, 1482. The loss of his excellent
mother was deeply felt by Lorenzo. ‘My reverence for
your Excellency,’ he wrote on the same day to the Duchess
of Ferrara, Eleonora d’Aragona d’Este,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> ‘commands me to
announce to you the sad and overwhelming event which has
this day befallen me, the death of my dearest mother
Madonna Lucrezia. It has plunged me in a grief which
your Excellency can imagine, for I have lost, not only my
mother, but my only refuge amid my many cares and difficulties,
the only helper who could aid and counsel me in my
many troubles. It is true that we must submit with patience
to the will of God, but I have not enough strength of mind
to bear such a calamity with calmness. I pray God to send
me more composure and comfort, and to grant peace and
blessedness to her soul. Your Excellency, towards whom I
give free course to my sorrow, will understand the state of
mind of your faithful servant, who commends himself to you
as heartily as he can.’</p>

<p>It is self-evident that Lorenzo had to consider his peculiar
position in planning the future connections of his children
as they grew up. He strove to reconcile the political needs
of this position with the traditions of the country, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
were against foreign marriages. The family alliance which
he formed between the Medici and the Cybò has this peculiarity,
that in this case, for the first time, the son of a Pope
was in some degree recognised and brought on the political
stage, the sad beginning of a grievous error in the history of
the Popedom. Before the middle of March, 1487, Giovanni
Lanfredini went to Rome to arrange preliminaries for a
contract of marriage between Lorenzo’s second daughter,
Maddalena, and Franceschetto Cybò, son of Innocent VIII.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
On the 22nd Lorenzo publicly announced ‘the family connection
concluded with me by his Holiness.’ The allies,
Naples and Milan, had been informed of the negotiations in
question. Lorenzo attached especial importance to the
king’s approval, because there had once been a project of
marriage between Franceschetto and a daughter of Ferrante,
and it was not till he had made sure of the latter’s
agreement that he formally concluded the contract with
Rome, or even discussed the matter with the Florentine
magistrates, to whom he submitted it for approval. ‘Our
opinion of the illustrious Lorenzo,’ so run Ferrante’s instructions
addressed, on May 1, to Trojano de’ Bottuni,
who was going as ambassador to Rome, Florence, and
Milan,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> ‘is so firmly established that the whole world could
produce no change in us. Wish him joy of the new connection,
which, in my opinion, is likely to be no less useful
to us than to him; for his influence on the Pope will operate
favourably to smooth the misunderstandings between his
Holiness and ourselves, and we only regret not having
known of the plan earlier that we might immediately have
given it our full agreement.’</p>

<p>‘Now may God guide all for the best,’ wrote Lorenzo
to the Florentine ambassador at Naples,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> ‘and give me
grace that the thing may benefit ourselves and others, and
be for our personal and the general advantage. Such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
are wont to be judged by their results more than by the rules
of reason.’ And he adds these honourable words: ‘As the
king wishes that the new connection shall have no disturbing
influence on our alliance, I give my word that this connection
shall not make me other than I was; for I have
never been so exclusively and passionately interested in my
own private affairs as to forget public honour or that which
beseems a straightforward and honest man. I believe the
king considers me as such, and he may be sure that if the
Pope should intend anything that might disturb peace I
should be the first to resist him. I know where to seek the
foundation of things, and what difficulties arise from the
daily events which go on gradually evolving themselves. I
think I have with no little trouble, care, and expense proved
my devotion to the king, and he may be sure that I shall
not sacrifice a substance to a shadow.’</p>

<p>Franceschetto Cybò has left no brilliant name in the
history of his father’s pontificate. He is supposed to have
been born in 1449 at Naples, where Giambattista Cybò&mdash;then
only seventeen&mdash;was living with his father Arano before
taking holy orders. When the father became Pope, Franceschetto
had a sister, Teodorina, who married into the
Usodimare family of Genoa. The mother’s name and rank
are unknown, and of Franceschetto himself nothing is
known till the time when he made this sudden appearance
on the world’s stage. He naturally was in no want of external
honours. He was made governor of Rome and
captain-general of the Church; his brother-in-law, Leo X.,
afterwards gave him the government of Spoleto, and he was
made a count of the Empire by the Emperor Frederic.
Fiefs were added to his titles. But he was without talent,
at once greedy of gain and a careless spendthrift. One
night, when taking part in the disorderly doings of some
young nobles, he lost 14,000 ducats at play to Cardinal
Raffaelle Riario. When the Pope lay in a seemingly hopeless
condition, struck by apoplexy, his son tried to get possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of his treasures; the result of which attempt was
that the cardinals made an inventory of them and entrusted
one of their own college with the care of them, though it
was said that Franceschetto had already managed to convey
a portion safely to Florence. His bride was still so young
that the marriage was put off. In the interval many things
happened which might have tempted Lorenzo to change his
mind, but for his earnest desire to gain a hold on Rome and
his hope of dominating the weak Pope, which was strengthened
by the events of 1487.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks after the conclusion of the treaty
disputes again arose between the Church and Naples, when
Aquila was subdued, the papal governor put to death, and
the papal banner torn down. An outbreak of persecution
against the barons increased the disagreement, and then the
king broke his word to the Pope by denying that either he
or his son had consented to pay the actual tribute. The
management of benefices went on in the usual arbitrary
manner. Innocent saw himself and his authority openly
set at naught. In January 1487, the Prince of Salerno, who
had quitted the kingdom before the net could be drawn tight
round him, arrived at Rome, where he was received with all
honours.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> His report of the proceedings added fuel to the
flame. Lodovico il Moro, who was always playing a double
game, declared himself unreservedly in opposition to the
king&mdash;with whom he was nevertheless at that moment treating
for the marriage of his nephew Gian Galeazzo&mdash;and held
out a threat of Venice taking part with the Pope, all of
which did not dispose Innocent to regard Ferrante’s conduct
calmly. The king soon discovered that his position was one
of some danger. On May 1, he sent Trojano de’ Bottuni as
envoy-extraordinary to Rome, Florence, and Milan.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> He
was to make the most of the undecided affair of Osimo and
the services therein rendered to the Pope; to put prominently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
forward the danger from the Turks; to explain the king’s
financial difficulties caused by the long-continued wars; and
to appeal to Lorenzo and Lodovico for support in case of
invasion. All this was mere show. If the Pope proved
obstinate the ambassador was instructed to explain that the
tribute was a formality rather than a contribution of money.
The king did not hold himself bound to the Pope, and he
had never ratified the consent given to the treaty of peace.
Moreover, the conditions of this peace had not been fulfilled
by his barons, and after the Pope had brought him into
endless difficulties and dangers, he was in nowise minded to
weaken his own forces still further in order to elevate his
Holiness. As for the Duke of Bari’s threat about Venice,
the ambassador might take the opinions of the Florentine
Signoria and Lorenzo, and try if possible to obtain a written
promise of help. The conduct of the barons had required
renewed and severer measures; their discontent greatly
astonished the king, as it would only bring trouble on the
Pope and the Venetians, and perhaps occasion a more
troublesome disaffection than the last. He relied entirely
on Florence and Lorenzo; the whole world should
not be able to change his opinion of the latter. Gioviano
Pontano, the same man who had made the treaty
with the Pope, drew up by the king’s orders instructions
which repudiated all the obligations undertaken at the
peace.</p>

<p>Ferrante was not mistaken in his expectation that
Lorenzo would do all in his power to prevent another conflagration;
but he was very much mistaken if he believed,
as he pretended to believe, that Lorenzo approved of his
proceedings. On his return from Sarzana, free at last from
that care, Lorenzo spoke out unreservedly his opinion respecting
his allies. He must have been angry indeed when
he, the true representative of Italian national policy, in his
delight at the progress of the French arms against Maximilian
in Flanders went so far as to declare that he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
hoped to see the king of France lord of all Italy.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> ‘This
shows,’ adds the Ferrarese ambassador, ‘how greatly his
Magnificence is put out; may God turn his heart to the
best.’ ‘The arrest of the barons,’ reports the same writer,
July 11, ‘has greatly displeased not only the illustrious
Lorenzo but also the whole city, and it is spoken of to the
king’s dishonour.’ The annexation of Genoa to Milan, and
the losses of Venice in the war with Archduke Sigismund
(so thought the ambassador), would probably incline the
Signoria to extreme caution, but Lorenzo’s expressions
against Lodovico, whom he regarded as the real disturber of
peace, were most violent. If the Duke of Bari continued
his crooked policy, Lorenzo believed the end would be that
the King of Naples would lay down the law for both Florence
and the Pope. If they both acted reasonably they would
keep together like their fathers before them and not plunge
Italy into danger. Lorenzo said he wished he could go and
bury himself for six months in some place where no rumour
of Italian affairs could reach his ears.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s ill-humour and anxiety is displayed in the
many letters written by him at this time to Lanfredini. It
was necessary, he wrote on July 17,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> that the Pope should
make sure of the attitude of Venice, but at the same time
take up a firm position, that he might not be suspected of
believing the king’s assurances that his proceedings against
the barons had been occasioned by their conduct since the
peace; for that suspicion would deprive him of all firm
security. Ten days after, he expressed his irritation at the
double-dealing of Sforza, who, pressed by the Neapolitan
envoy, wrote at the same time letters to his brother the
cardinal in favour of the king, and others to his agent in
Rome in agreement with the Papal views. The object of
Sforza’s apparent partisanship with Ferrante was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to hinder the latter from forming an alliance with Venice if
he saw Florence and Milan arrayed against him. But the
first thing to be done was for all the Italian States to stand
fast by the Pope and show no wavering. ‘Certainly all
desire peace, but I think no one will suffer the Pope to be
insulted and oppressed.’</p>

<p>The king’s defence of his proceedings convinced nobody.
In the latter half of July, Innocent held a consistory on the
condition of affairs in Naples. The whole college of Cardinals
agreed with him that the honour of the Holy See no
longer permitted him to look on unmoved. Letters were to
be written concerning the breach of the treaty to the King
of Spain, to Milan and Florence, who had guaranteed its
fulfilment. A nuncio was to be sent to Naples to protest,
and, in case the barons had recently failed in their duty, to
move for proper legal proceedings against them, with the
participation of the Pope. Instructions to this effect were
drawn up on July 24 for Pietro Vicentino, bishop of Cesena.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
But the king treated the nuncio in the most unworthy manner.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
He refused him an audience; and when the bishop,
having watched the moment when Ferrante was starting for
the chase, stopped him in the doorway and compelled him
to listen to his demands, he gained nothing by it. He demanded
in the Pope’s name three things; payment of the
tribute, abstinence from all unlawful meddling in spiritual
affairs, and the cessation of proceedings against the barons.
To the first point Ferrante answered that he had no money,
having spent everything on the war begun against him by
the Pope, so that the latter must still be patient for a few
years. To the second, that <i>he</i> knew what persons in the
kingdom were fit for benefices, but the Curia did not, and it
was sufficient for the Pope to confirm those appointed by the
King. Lastly, as to the third point; as the Pope had upon
treasonable practices imprisoned Cardinals Colonna and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Savelli, and set them free again at his own will and pleasure,
so the king had a right to arrest traitorous subjects and let
them go again just as he thought good. Thereupon he
caused the horns to be blown and rode away to the chase,
without even turning to salute the bishop. ‘If I have lately
been silent as to the Neapolitan business,’ wrote Lorenzo to
Lanfredini on August 10,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> ‘the reason is not that I have
changed my mind, but that I will take no more trouble
for nothing. If his Holiness has confidence in me, as you
say, it is my duty to regard only his Holiness’s honour.
The more I think over the matter, the more I am confirmed
in my view, that the Pope must neither yield his rights to
the king nor make war upon him. The way to avoid both
extremes seems to me to be this: that the Pope should
without delay take every measure to maintain his rights as
to the question of homage, but on the other hand avoid
everything that might lead to a passage of arms or to an
interdict. We are not in a fit condition for making war,
and the circumstances of Italy in general, as well as those of
the States of the Church in especial, will not sustain a shock.
An interdict unsupported by arms produces little effect;
therefore I think for the present the matter is best left
alone. But this would not be the case if the Pope gave in
about the tribute, whether by diminishing or remitting the
debt; for at this moment it would do no good, and be a
clear loss. If the king attaches to this affair the importance
he seems to do, then, should a concession be needed, a time
more favourable to the Pope’s interests could be found. I
do not in the least fear that because the Papal rights are
upheld, the king will proceed to a hostile demonstration.
He would stand without justification, and others would not
support him. This is my opinion, expressed only for the
Pope himself; for it is better for our object that I should
appear to be persuading him to come to terms with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
king. My lord Lodovico and many others hold the same
view. If the Pope agrees, he must manage so as not to get
me and others into trouble, but wait for time and opportunity.’
The attitude of Venice confirmed Lorenzo still
more in his view that Rome must not push matters to an
extremity. ‘The Venetians’ answer,’ he wrote on August
31, ‘seems to me to be very vague and gives little response
to the confidence placed in the Republic by his Holiness. I
think it would be well if the Pope showed some little vexation
at it, without exactly taking the thing really amiss,
particularly with regard to their war with the Germans, and
the defeat and death of my lord Roberto [Sanseverino]. In
any case, however, they must be impressed with the king’s
power, and the ease with which he could damage the States
of the Church, so as to get their views in case of such an
event, and find out how far they may be reckoned on. It
would at the same time be an opportunity for urging them
to peace with the Germans; for, in truth, all sorts of evil
fruits arise from their being busy in that quarter; and I
think the Pope would do well to exhort the Venetians to
make peace, and to support them, that they may regain
freedom of action.’</p>

<p>Thus did Lorenzo look to the distant as well as the immediate
prospect. But Innocent VIII. was not the man to
take up a firm position; he let himself be ruled by momentary
impulses. On September 3, Gian Jacopo Trivulzio,
loaded with honours by the Pope after the settlement of the
Osimo affair, on his return to Milan came to Florence; here
he was splendidly received by the foreign ambassadors and
many distinguished citizens, with Piero de’ Medici at their
head, and lodged in the convent of Sta. Croce. The cardinal
of S. Peter in Vinculis was with him. Lorenzo was at Pisa.
Trivulzio was commissioned by the Pope to tell him that he
trusted entirely to him, and would be guided by him; but if
he guided him amiss it would be the ruin of both. And
hereupon the Pope broke into violent complaints against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
king. But the Milanese captain’s account of Innocent was
not such as to strengthen the confidence of the Republic in
him. ‘Messer Gian Jacopo,’ wrote the Ferrarese ambassador,
‘tells of the Pope’s faint-heartedness and want of
head and spirit, and that he acts after the fashion of an utter
simpleton;’ and adds that ‘if somebody does not put a little
spirit into him and keep him alive, he will come to a most
pitiful end.’ On the 6th the news reached Florence that
the king had appealed to the council. Though Innocent
regarded the appeal as null, and declared it contrary to
Ferrante’s own agreements with his predecessor, still it was
believed that the threat would frighten him.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This, however,
proved a mistake.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the second week in September
Lorenzo went from Pisa to the hill-country of Volterra,
where he had an estate on the heights that slope down towards
the lower part of the Era valley; a district beautifully
cultivated, but less fertile than the valley of the Arno. This
estate had been during the thirteenth century a settlement
of the Hospitaliers of Altopascio, and had thence taken the
name of Spedaletto.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Here Lorenzo was wont to take the
waters of Morba, brought to him daily by messengers on
horseback; for Spedaletto was more healthily situated and
more convenient for communication. Hither, on September
10, just as he had despatched Francesco Valori with commissions
to Naples, recommending him to consult with
Lanfredini at Rome, there arrived at his residence a Papal
secretary who had vainly sought for him at Pisa. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Jacopo Gherardi of Volterra, sent by Innocent with secret
commissions to Lorenzo and Lodovico.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The object of the
interview was to draw both, together with Venice, into a
formal league against King Ferrante. Lorenzo’s reception
of the Pope’s proposals shows that he, who, notwithstanding
his friendship and connection with Innocent, had anything
but a high opinion of the latter’s political tact and firmness,
was anxious not to risk the peace of Italy, attained with so
much difficulty. However much he might be angered by
Ferrante’s faithlessness and violence, yet the weakness of
the Pope, the trickery of Sforza, and the ambition of Venice
caused him such grave anxiety that he determined to ward
off a new conflict as much as possible. He held to the views
expressed to Lanfredini, and warned the Pope against using
either his spiritual or temporal power in arms. The Papal
treasury was exhausted, the armed force slight, there was
no good leader at hand equal to the responsibility, nor
would it be easy to find one; the king was prepared, the inhabitants
of the States of the Church were not at unity
among themselves, and many were discontented. Neither
was there harmony in the College of Cardinals. The circumstances
of the Pope and his State were not such that
he ought to enter on a fresh war; the interests of all the
other Italian States demanded peace. As for honour, which
in Innocent’s opinion was endangered by the conduct of
the king, Lorenzo thought that a Pope’s honour could never
be endangered through his defending his rights by means of
just protestations, without disturbing the peace of Italy.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s advice was that the Papal envoy should not
proceed to Milan. But the Pope insisted, and Lorenzo, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his permission, drew up for Gherardi’s benefit fresh instructions
which would prevent any real engagement, however
much Sforza might wish to meddle. These negotiations
continued till the end of the first week in October. Who
would believe that while the bow was so tightly strung and
the danger of a rupture was hovering nearer and nearer, the
king, who was openly defying the Pope and seeking to defend
his own conduct by embassies to all the allied courts,
proposed to this same Pope a special alliance, which was to
put an end to all differences? Yet so it was, and the Bishop
of Carinola came to Rome with such a proposition. The
Pope informed the Florentine ambassador of it, and gave
him a copy of the bishop’s instructions. Lorenzo already
knew of the matter, but was in doubt as to the views of
Innocent. He spoke out plainly, in his answer to Lanfredini,
intended for communication to the Pope,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> his own
opinion&mdash;that the king only intended to mislead the Pope
and keep him occupied, while he himself kept to the course
he had begun; and all the more so, because the instructions
contained nothing but generalities. Secondly, Ferrante
might be trying to separate the Pope from him, Lorenzo,
well knowing that then he could do as he pleased with the
former. Lastly, his object was to make sure whether the
Pope stood firm to his resolves and counted on foreign support.
‘As for me,’ he continued, ‘you know I will never
advise his Holiness to do anything unworthy of him, or
which may disturb the peace of Italy. But as I warned the
holy father through you, only a little while ago, not to build
on hopes of foreign help, so I am now of opinion that he
must not let himself be turned by what seems to me fair
words and figures of speech from a design which he considers
reasonable. If his Holiness is minded to come to
terms with the king, in order to put out this spark which
may light a great fire, then I think it can be done by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of a general Italian alliance. From such I should expect
three results. First, a vindication of the agreement between
the Pope and the king, so that the first would appear to
postpone his own interest to the general good and the
tranquillity of Italy. Secondly, greater security for the
king’s fidelity to the treaty, which the Pope must require
after the experience he has had. Thirdly, a confirmation of
the good understanding with the other Italian powers, particularly
with Venice; which understanding would be endangered
if the Pope should close with the king alone.’ The
whole despatch is a clear proof how little confidence the
writer felt, on the one hand, in the Pope’s firmness, and on
the other in Ferrante’s honour, and how his own desire to
preserve peace outweighed everything else. He requested
the ambassador to do all he could with Innocent, at whose
court there was no lack of intrigues and counter-intrigues,
that the king might not be led to suspect him, Lorenzo, of
opposing an accommodation, which suspicion would damage
his own position with Ferrante; but this was the fruit of
oft-repeated experience. That he should try to keep in the
Pope’s good graces was only natural. ‘My first desire,’ he
wrote, ‘is to agree with the views of the holy father. This
is my duty, rather than to give him advice. For I believe
the Pope to be more conversant with the things of this
world than the king’s instructions seem to assume; and he
has reigned long enough not to need directions from the
king as to his bearing towards us and others.’</p>

<p>During all this negotiating backwards and forwards, Lodovico
il Moro, who was a person to be considered in the matter,
had fallen seriously ill. In August 1487, he was seized with
such an alarming disorder of the stomach that the Duke of
Ferrara expressed a wish that Lorenzo would send to Milan
his own physician, Piero Leone, who was considered the
most skilful man of his time. In November, Sforza’s condition
was so much worse that the friends of the family
summoned his only living brother, the Cardinal Ascanio, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
order to be prepared to take his place if he died. On
November 18, the Cardinal came through Florence incognito,
with a few horsemen, and in such haste that he changed
horses at every post. Lorenzo and he had not always
agreed well together; but now he said that he would, in
case of need, support him, and try to go hand in hand with
him and the Pope. The danger in which Lodovico lay
passed slowly by. The Papal affair made no progress at all.
Venice, having made peace with Sigismund, threatened war
against Naples; Milan let King Ferrante know that he
must not reckon on her alliance if he did not alter his conduct
towards Rome; the king persisted in his defiance and
in his measures against the barons; the Pope tried to make
money, and threatened him with an interdict. Lorenzo,
highly displeased at the whole state of affairs, did all in his
power to restrain Innocent from taking the extreme steps
he meditated.</p>

<p class="pch">FAMILY EVENTS. MARRIAGES AND DEATHS.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> marriage of Maddalena de’ Medici with Franceschetto
Cybò took place about this time. When her journey to
Rome was partially decided on, Lorenzo wrote to Lanfredini,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
without making any positive statement on the subject:
‘Clarice, my wife, is partly minded to visit her relations
there, and at the same time to try the effect of the Roman
air, as you know that of our neighbourhood does not suit
her in winter. You formerly mentioned a desire that
Maddalena should go to Rome. If this is still the case, she
might conveniently accompany her mother. These are our
own present plans, which you can communicate to the Pope
and Signor Francesco. If they are pleased with them, the
thing shall take place, but not otherwise.’ On November 4,
1487, Madonna Clarice set out for Rome with her daughter
the bride, her eldest son, the Bishop of Arezzo, Jacopo Salviati,
and a numerous suite. Lorenzo did not omit to give
his daughter on her departure from home precepts and advice
such as he knew how to give wisely and well. He reminded
her of her own descent and family, as well as of the
position she was about to take; of the consideration due
both to the Roman people and to the Pope, with whom
she was to be so nearly connected; of her duty towards her
husband; of the precepts of honour and obedience, and of
respect to her elders and superiors in rank. On arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
near the city the travellers were met by the bridegroom,
with some prelates of the Pope’s household, several ambassadors
and members of the Florentine colony at Rome, amid
whom they were conducted to the Leonine city. Here
Franceschetto dwelt in a house built by his uncle Maurigio,
near that in which Charlotte de Lusignan, queen of Cyprus,
had died after a long exile, on June 12 of that same year.
The servants of the prelates and those of the ambassadors
and the Medici rode foremost. On Franceschetto’s right
rode his future brother-in-law, Piero, on his left, Jacopo
Salviati, with whom he was to be similarly connected. The
bride rode between the Archbishop of Cosenza and the
Bishop of Oria, her mother between the Milanese ambassador
(the Bishop of Roveredo) and the Bishop of Volterra.
Prelates, jurists, ladies and others followed.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> On the Sunday
before the 24th, the day on which the Venetian envoys
Sebastiano Badoer and Bernardo Bembo were received in a
secret consistory, the Pope gave a banquet at his palace to
Clarice and her daughter, at which the bridegroom, the
Florentine ambassador, and several prelates were present.
To the bride he presented jewels to the value of about eight
thousand ducats, to Franceschetto, one of two thousand.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> On
January 20, 1488, the marriage contract was signed.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Franceschetto
was in his thirty-ninth year; his bride was yet in
her girlhood, gentle and bashful. One of those sent by her
father to accompany her always calls her <i>la fanciulla</i>. Her
dowry does not seem to have been large; four thousand
ducats, part in cash, part in state bonds. From a letter of
Lorenzo to Lanfredini,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> it appears that this sum was not
ready at the time of the wedding. ‘You know how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
holes I have to fill up.’ But Franceschetto was no loser.
In the days of Paul II. the countship of Anguillara had been
taken from its ancient lords, on account of their repeated
rebellions, and given to the Apostolic Chamber. The relatives
of Everso of Anguillara had never ceased to protest,
and we have already pointed out that after the death of
Sixtus IV. Deifebo regained possession of the castles.
Lorenzo made terms with the claimants by means of a considerable
sum, and offered the county to Cybò as an addition
to Maddalena’s dowry; whereupon, on February 21,
1490, Innocent VIII. conferred on Franceschetto the fief of
Anguillara, without mentioning the transaction, so as not
to call in question the rights of the Chamber. In 1487
Franceschetto had bought of Bartolommeo della Rovere the
Roman castles of Cerveteri and Sta. Severa.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> These places,
alienated after the Pope’s death to the Orsini of Bracciano,
were, at the beginning of Alexander VI.’s reign, near kindling
a war which threatened to set all Italy on fire. This
was not all the wealth that the Cybò gained by their
connection with the Medici. In Tuscany they acquired
property. The palace of Jacopo de’ Pazzi passed to Lorenzo’s
son-in-law, whose descendants long possessed both it and
the country-house of the Pazzi at Montughi.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The Medici’s
estate in the Volterra district, which also passed to the
Cybò, has been already mentioned. The intended acquisition
of the unfinished Pitti Palace came to nothing.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, who always knew how to combine his love of
splendour with useful aims, and judged others from the
same point of view, had no very high opinion of his son-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
‘As you have before heard from me,’ he wrote to
Lanfredini before the marriage on November 4, 1487, when
Franceschetto had got himself made captain-general,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> ‘I
think Signor Francesco should not pursue mere smoke;
things without moderation do not suit me. A captain ought
to have seen service and made himself a reputation. I wish
he had rather sought to secure a maintenance, and I wonder
it does not strike him that the day after the Pope dies he
will be the poorest man on earth, and I shall have to provide
for him and his wife. Endeavour to make this clear to him
if you see that he hankers after titles and vanities; I must
speak to him freely and then help him, however he may take
it. I hear he keeps aloof from frivolous people and those of
evil report, and that he avoids play. We must support him
as much as possible, and lovingly point out to him what is
becoming, if we are to fulfil our duty.’ Lorenzo did not
wish his son to remain in Rome longer than was absolutely
necessary. On December 9, he wrote to his wife desiring
that Piero should return with the bishop and Jacopo Salviati
as soon as he had despatched certain business of his own,
of which more will be said hereafter. Piero returned to
Florence, the bishop remained. Lorenzo wrote repeatedly
to Clarice leaving the length of her stay to her own decision,
but expressing a wish, towards the end of the winter, that
she might stay somewhat longer.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Everything did not go
according to Lorenzo’s wishes. The elevation of his son
Giovanni to the cardinalate, undoubtedly one of the motives
for the match, was delayed; Clarice was ill; and the home
arrangements of the Cybò seem not to have suited Florentine
and Medicean ideas. ‘I have received,’ wrote Lorenzo to
Lanfredini on April 11, 1488,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> ‘your information about
Clarice, and am grieved at it, though her ill-health is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
new to me. I have informed her of the cause which
will somewhat delay Piero’s departure from here, but let her
not trouble herself about it if she wishes to return here
sooner, though I should be glad if she could wait for Alfonsina
[Piero’s bride]. I wish Maddalena might come with
her, for the latter is still quite a child, and Signor Francesco’s
household is badly managed; and, besides, she would be a
comfort to Clarice. But I should wish this to be done with
the full consent and without the slightest dissatisfaction of
his Holiness or Signor Francesco, and I should take it as a
favour.’ And after recurring to the insecure position of his
son-in-law, he adds: ‘His Holiness seems to me to go to
work with great lukewarmness in all these things. Independently
of Signor Francesco I also regret that my
daughter should find herself in unfavourable circumstances,
and I am in a kind of despair over this and other matters
when I hear of the slowness and carelessness yonder.’</p>

<p>Madonna Clarice stayed in Rome till May 1488, when
her son Piero came with Giovanni Tornabuoni to fetch her
back. From a letter written to Lorenzo by their companion
Poliziano, on May 2,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> it appears that on that day Piero set
out from Acquapendente to Viterbo, and that the travellers
were all in good health and spirits and did not forget to
celebrate the merry month of May with songs and various
amusements on their journey. Piero’s expedition had also
another object, he was going to bring home his own bride.
On April 16 Lorenzo wrote to Lanfredini:<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> ‘My Piero
starts in a few days to go and fetch his wife, and also to
help Clarice. If the latter is able to travel I shall be very
glad.’ As well as an unknown son-in-law Lorenzo had
chosen an unknown daughter-in-law; but she came of a
family which had long been intimately associated with his
and had many relations with the Republic, at the same time
enjoying the special favour of the ruling house of Naples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Alfonsina Orsini was the daughter of a man who had preserved
and displayed his loyalty to the house of Aragon
when most of his own people were in the enemy’s camp.
Roberto Orsini was a younger son of that Carlo from whom
sprang the line of Bracciano, afterwards the principal branch
of this wide-spreading race. He had fought for King
Ferrante against the Angevins, and for the Florentines
against Bartolommeo Colleone, and died of sickness at Siena
in 1476. One of his children by his second marriage with
Caterina da Sanseverino was Alfonsina, thus named in
honour of Aragon. She was married by proxy at Castelnuovo
towards the end of February 1487, in presence of the
royal pair and other members of the reigning family. Ferrante
laid aside his family mourning on this day, and after
supper there was a festival and a ball. The bridegroom was
represented by Bernardo Rucellai; the bride’s next of kin by
her cousin Gentil Virginio, lord of Bracciano. Alfonsina
brought a dowry of 12,000 ducats, which popular belief
magnified to 30,000.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> A whole year passed before Piero
brought her home. Her entry into Florence was to have
taken place on May 22, 1488, but the Medici family were
in mourning for the death of the third daughter, Luigia; so,
instead of coming to the city, the young couple went to
Careggi. About ten days afterwards Lorenzo gave, in
honour of his daughter-in-law and her suite, a grand
banquet, at which the chief men of the city and the foreign
ambassadors were present.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>There was no lack of festivities in Florence, and the
Medici contributed not a little to their splendour. Maddalena
Cybò came with her mother and sister-in-law; Franceschetto
followed her on June 22. He was accompanied by
Giorgio Santacroce of an old Roman family, Girolamo
Tuttavilla, son of Cardinal d’Estouteville, and many others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
‘We received him,’ wrote Lorenzo to Lanfredini two days
after,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> ‘heartily rather than splendidly. Yesterday he made
a visit to the Signoria; his appearance, bearing, and mode
of speech give general satisfaction. As yet I have been
little alone with him. I will endeavour to fulfil the Pope’s
wishes; you will then report to me what he thinks of us on
this first meeting. I will take care that he finds occasion to
come to us often.’ The Florentines helped Lorenzo in this. In
honour of his son-in-law’s presence numerous diversions for
the people and magnificent spectacles were arranged. It
was long since Florence had beheld such triumphal processions,
such improvised buildings, arches, and other decorations,
though they had long been customary there. Franceschetto,
who had been presented with the freedom of the city,
did all he could to make himself popular, and succeeded.
When he rode through the streets on the feast of St. John
the children shouted, ‘Cybò and Palle!’ From the piazza
of the Signoria to that of the cathedral there was such a
throng that great wax candles and other consecrated gifts
could not be carried to the Baptistery; and when the street
officials tried to clear a space, the people cried out that they
wanted to see Lorenzo’s son-in-law, the Pope’s son. Franceschetto
occupied the place of honour next to the Gonfalonier
at the public banquet given by the Signoria to the
distinguished nobles who were in the city and the foreign
ambassadors, among whom, besides those of the friendly
Italian powers, the Turkish envoy was present. Giovanni
Tornabuoni, Bernardo Rucellai, Lorenzo, son of Pier-Francesco
de’ Medici, and others, gave banquets and festivities;
the latter gave one at his villa at Castello, situated to
the west of the city on a gentle slope overlooking the valley
of the Arno where it spreads out into a beautiful plain.
Lorenzo saw his daughter and son-in-law daily. But throughout
all the rejoicings of which his house was the centre, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was not free from cares of all kinds. The bad state of
affairs in Romagna will be mentioned presently; in his
own home there were other causes for discomfort and
anxiety.</p>

<p>Lorenzo himself was ill and overwhelmed with business.
Ser Piero da Bibiena wrote to Lanfredini on June 26:<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
‘Lorenzo has ridden out to Monte Paldi [a factory now
belonging to the Corsini, in the neighbourhood of San
Casciano] to get a little air and freedom from this mass of
business. For two months he had not left the city; he
intends to be back on Saturday.’ A few days before this
the Ferrarese ambassador wrote that Lorenzo positively
must go to the baths, but it was very difficult for him to get
away. His own health was not his only trouble; for a long
time past Clarice had been ill. It was hoped that native air
would do her good, but not only did her condition not improve,
but, even before her return from Rome, it became
such as to cause anxiety; and the interior of the household
must have been little suited to the festivities occasioned by
the presence of two newly-married couples. The mother
could not bear the thought of parting from her daughter.
‘Signor Francesco,’ wrote Lorenzo to Lanfredini on June
30,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> ‘thinks of setting out in a week, and, as I understand,
taking Maddalena with him. I have not yet spoken of it to
him, but I should be glad if you would mention the matter
to his Holiness and get it arranged that she should remain
here the rest of the summer and autumn. I have two chief
motives for this wish. First, Clarice is very ill, so much so
that the doctors are doubtful whether the disease will soon
end fatally or whether it will drag on and the immediate
danger pass over; secondly, the air yonder is unhealthy,
and Maddalena is not used to it. For these reasons, and
also because I have never yet had time to see my daughter
comfortably, I earnestly beg his Holiness that of his kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he will let me have her a few more months and write
to Signor Francesco accordingly, so that the occasion may
not appear to have come from us.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s desire was fulfilled. On July 4, he received
from Rome the news that the Pope had determined to entrust
Franceschetto with a mission to Perugia, and to leave
his wife in Florence for a time. It may easily be imagined
how pleasing this last arrangement was to Lorenzo; the
former seemed rather questionable to the experienced politician.
‘This Perugian affair,’ he wrote at once to Lanfredini,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
‘seems to me very grave, and such as may create
embarrassment; all the more so as Signor Francesco has had
no practice in such things, and has no one near him to whom
anything important can be entrusted.’ Then, after relating
how he dined the day before with his son-in-law at Careggi,
and they had visited the Petraja and other places, which he
had much liked, he continues: ‘Maddalena will remain here,
to which Signor Francesco seems quite agreed. Clarice
could not be worse than she is now, and I fear we shall soon
lose her. You can imagine what comfort she finds in the
presence of her daughter, who has always seemed to me to
be the apple of her eye (<i>l’occhio del capo suo</i>); so we are
both very grateful to his Holiness. Of myself I say nothing,
for you know how I love my children, especially in the present
case.’</p>

<p>On July 6, Franceschetto Cybò left Florence. His experiences
at Perugia will be mentioned hereafter. Lorenzo,
though much in need of the baths, was detained in the city
by the weak state of Clarice and the pressure of business.
At last, on the morning of July 21, he set out for Filetta
in the Merse Vale in the Sienese territory. It is a small
village consisting of only a few houses, in a valley surrounded
with woods; the waters of the neighbouring sulphur-springs
of Macereto have been brought thither, and it lies lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and deserted on the road leading from Siena to Grosseto
and the Maremma. In the summer of 1813 Emperor Henry
of Luxemburg was carried thither, with the hand of death
upon him; in 1459 Pope Pius II., who repeatedly visited
the waters of his native land, sought relief from his inveterate
enemy the gout in these springs. Scarcely had Lorenzo
arrived at Filetta when the fatal news reached him&mdash;Clarice
died on the afternoon of July 30. The day before, Ser Piero
had written to Lanfredini:<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> ‘I know not what to tell you
of Madonna Clarice; she gets better for a day or two, and
then gets worse again, so that she is slowly approaching
dissolution.’ The dissolution came much quicker than was
expected, yet it hardly looks well that Lorenzo should leave
the city when her state was so critical, and that he did not
return on hearing that she was worse. ‘If you should hear
Lorenzo blamed for not being present at his wife’s death,’
wrote Ser Piero to Lanfredini on July 31, ‘excuse him.
Leoni (the physician) considered it necessary for his health
for him to go to the baths, and no one thought death was so
near.’ The Ferrarese ambassador confirms the statement
that, according to the doctors’ advice, Lorenzo’s stay at the
baths was absolutely necessary, and all his friends had entreated
him not to return till the cure was completed. On
the evening after her death Clarice de’ Medici was entombed
without pomp in San Lorenzo, and on the following morning
all the ambassadors present in Florence went to Piero to
offer their condolences. The solemn obsequies, at which the
whole city was present, took place on August 1.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Lorenzo’s
wife was not quite forty. No notice is to be found in his
writings of the woman who shared the lights and shadows
of life with him for nineteen years; an idea of their conjugal
relations can be formed only from a few words of his in
earlier days, and the inadequate testimony of contemporaries,
which seems to indicate that their views and inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
did not always agree. Clarice’s disagreement with such a
celebrated man as Poliziano has tended to bias the judgment
of her contemporaries against her. Nevertheless, this
daughter of an old Roman baronial house, obliged, when
young and inexperienced, to enter a strange world as the
wife of a man for whom she had no affection, displayed in
all things tact and sound judgment; without putting herself
forward she did honour to her position and her husband,
and she brought up her children tenderly and carefully.
Her feelings and her relations to Lorenzo are indicated,
amongst others, by the following letter, written to her husband
from Caffaggiuolo on December 13 of the year they
were so long separated, 1478, on behalf of a servant who
had been dismissed for some misconduct.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> ‘Illustrious husband,’
she wrote; ‘Andrea your messenger has been up here
for two days, and earnestly begged me to put in a good word
for him as he is deeply grieved for his fault. I therefore
beg you to keep him with you or procure him another situation;
for, as he has formerly shown his fidelity, you would
be acting contrary to your nature if you did not forgive him
his error, besides being responsible for his falling into worse
ways; also you might inadvertently by this means discourage
others who are faithful to you. He has a mother
who was delighted at his position in your service, and is now
in like measure distressed, fearing that her son may, if you
dismiss him, go astray and bring her to sorrow. He has
already expiated his fault by grief and shame; for, since
you sent him away, he has been like one beside himself and
has never had a moment’s happiness. I think he is especially
touched on the point of honour, which is a good sign
and should have weight with you. I beg you therefore
to be indulgent to him, whether for the sake of his proved
fidelity, or from pity for his mother, or because he shows
right feeling, or, lastly, for the sake of my intercession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
either by taking him back or by providing for him in some
other way.’</p>

<p>A letter written to Innocent VIII. the day after Clarice’s
death<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> displays a warmth of feeling which, after the passages
that have been mentioned, one would hardly have
expected from Lorenzo, and which give a favourable impression
of him: ‘I am too often obliged to trouble your
Holiness with what is daily sent me by fate and prepared
for me by the will of God, against which all striving is vain,
and to which everyone must bow with patience and humility,
accepting His ways as tokens of goodness and love. But
the recent death of my sweet and beloved companion Clarice
is for numberless reasons such a grief and loss to me that it
has conquered my resignation and endurance amid the trials
and persecutions of fate, against which I thought myself
proof. Bereaved of the pleasant society to which I was
accustomed, I feel the limit is passed, and I can find no
comfort or rest for my deep sorrow. As I do not cease to
pray the Lord God to give me peace, I trust that of His
goodness He will put an end to this sorrow and spare me
any more such trials as have visited me lately. I humbly
and from my inmost heart beseech your Holiness to pray for
me, for I know your prayers will do me good. Filetta, July
31.’ August 6, Lorenzo returned to Florence, from whence
he wrote to the ambassador at Rome on behalf of an Englishman
who was going thither to procure a Papal brief and
had been specially recommended to him by the Queen,
Elizabeth of York. Two days later, he apologised to Lanfredini
for not having answered some business questions:<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
‘You know the cause; when my mind is entirely occupied
with one thing, it cannot think of anything else.’</p>

<p>Clarice’s death obliged Lorenzo to seek a companion for
his daughter to take her back to Rome. He chose a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
relative, Maria de’ Medici, widow of Galeazzo Malatesta.
‘Maddalena,’ he wrote to Lanfredini on September 3,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
‘starts to-morrow for Rome. She will be accompanied by
my Piero and my uncle Giovanni, who will take her as far
as Acquapendente, as arranged by Signor Francesco. I
have chosen for her companion one Madonna Maria de’
Medici, widow of Signor Galeazzo Malatesta and daughter
of Madonna Ciulla. She is a very well-bred and truly venerable
lady over fifty, who since her widowhood has lived the
retired life of a nun. I think that the more Signor Francesco
thinks over this choice of mine, the better pleased he
will be.’ Maddalena remained with her husband in Rome,
whence she wrote to her father, September 1 of the next
year, that she was about to become a mother. The young
wife’s days seem not to have been very cheerful ones.
When she went to Rome with her mother, Lorenzo sent
with her a man whom he trusted and who was faithfully
attached to his house&mdash;the same Ser Matteo Franco whose
name holds a place in the history of burlesque poetry. He
was Maddalena’s adviser and confidant, her man of business
and, perhaps, her house-chaplain; and his many letters to
members of the Medicean household display a sympathy and
warmth of feeling doubly pleasing in such a jovial man.
Franceschetto neglected his young wife, who fretted continually,
while he passed the nights in play and feasting.
With no one to keep her company, she soon languished and
lost her health, thinking regretfully of her father’s house
and the pleasant villas around Florence, where she had
passed her happy childhood.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>A few days after the loss of Clarice, another death took
place which did not affect the Medici family personally, but
whose consequences had no little influence on the family
relations which were closely connected with later political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
events. On August 19, at the castle of Capuano near
Naples, died at the age of forty-two Ippolita Maria, Duchess
of Calabria.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Her death broke the ties which bound together
the Houses of Aragon and the Sforza. This was probably
not perceived at the moment, for not only did the alliance
continue which seemed to unite the two states, but the
death caused no change in the plans for the new connection
long decided on between the two families, whereby their
interests were to be yet more closely and firmly linked together.
But the death of this clever and accomplished
woman dissolved the union between Ippolita’s husband and
brother, two men who were willing and accustomed to sacrifice
every consideration and every scruple to their ambition,
greed and hatred, and who, since the Ferrarese war, had regarded
each other with ever-increasing distrust and ill-will.
The longer Lodovico il Moro held the reins of government in
Milan, the less disposed he was to surrender them to his
nephew, who, although now nineteen years old, was still
duke only in title. Whether the accusation is true that
Lodovico had neglected the youth’s education to such an
extent that, delicate as he had been from childhood, he was
unfit to govern, must be left an open question. At all
events, Gian-Galeazzo took no part in public affairs, and
though everything was done in the name of the Duke of
Milan, it all went through the hands of the Duke of Bari.
From early childhood Gian-Galeazzo had been betrothed to
his cousin Isabella. Alfonso of Calabria had already often
pressed for the completion of the marriage; and as the
bride was now eighteen, Lodovico at last had to yield. The
mourning for the Duchess was not yet over, when, on December
11, Hermes Sforza, Gian-Galeazzo’s younger brother,
arrived in the bay of Naples with six galleys, and with a
brilliant suite landed to fetch his future sister-in-law, whose
father came to meet him and conducted him to the king and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
queen at Castelnuovo. On the 21st of the same month
Hermes, in his brother’s name, placed the wedding-ring on
Isabella’s finger. The court mourning prevented all festivities.
A gloomy shadow seemed to hang over this marriage,
which was destined to bring nothing but suffering and
misery to the contracting parties.</p>

<p>Its early days, however, were not lacking in splendour.
On December 30 the young Duchess of Milan embarked,
accompanied as far as the Molo by her father, her grandparents
and their court. Many distinguished Milanese and
Genoese had come with Hermes Sforza; among them Vitaliano
Borromeo, Gasparo Visconti, Ambrosio del Maino,
and Giovan Francesco da Sanseverino Count of Cajazzo (son
of Roberto). Ten galleys were filled by these and the Neapolitan
suite, the Duke and Duchess of Melfi, the Countess
of Terranuova, the Counts of Potenza and Consa, and others.
They touched at Civitavecchia, Piombino, and Livorno. At
the first-named port the bride was received by the Cardinals
Sforza, Riario, and de Foix, with the Senator of Rome; at
Piombino by Jacopo IV. Appiani. At Livorno, Lorenzo,
again confined at home by the gout, was represented by his
son Piero, accompanied by Pier Antonio Carnesecchi and
Alessandro Nasi. The Republic sent Jacopo Guicciardini,
Pier Filippo Pandolfini, and Paol’Antonio Soderini as envoys
to welcome the Duchess; but Lorenzo’s son put them
all in the shade by his princely appearance. It was the
same at Milan, whither Piero went towards the end of
January 1489, to be present at Isabella’s triumphal entry
and the final marriage, which took place on Candlemas day.
On reaching the Milanese frontier, Piero was received by
several nobles sent by il Moro to form his train. At the
wedding in the cathedral, where the ceremony was performed
by Federigo Sanseverino (another son of Roberto,
and afterwards a Cardinal), Piero outshone everybody;
though the splendour was such that, as a reporter wrote to
Lorenzo, the very cooks were in velvet and silk. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
ceremony the Ducal couple sent to Piero to fetch his attire
and admire it again. Lodovico exhausted himself in attentions
towards the son of the man in whose hands were the
destinies of Florence. ‘It seems a perfect marvel,’ wrote
the Florentine ambassador, Piero Alamanni, on January 31,
1489, ‘to all these Lombards, as well as to the ambassadors,
that young as he [Piero] is, he maintains such a dignified
bearing and discourses on everything with so much readiness.
Yesterday morning my lord Lodovico spoke for half
an hour in his praise before the ambassadors, and assigned
to him a place of honour next Messer Galeotto della Mirandola,
Rodolfo Gonzaga, and Annibale Bentivoglio.’ After
the nuptial ceremony Alamanni was knighted by the young
Duke and presented with a splendid robe of brocade, and his
spurs were fastened on by Galeazzo and Gian Francesco da
Sanseverino. The splendour of the festivities was such as
the Milanese court had been wont to display since the days
of Galeazzo Maria.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">TROUBLES IN ROMAGNA. TUSCAN AND UMBRIAN NEIGHBOURS.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> same year 1488, which brought to Lorenzo’s family
festivals and family mourning, involved him in political
complications with the Republic of a very serious character.
The territory on the side nearest Romagna was threatened,
and the amicable relations of Florence with her allies, and
especially with Milan, was thereby greatly endangered.</p>

<p>After the death of Sixtus IV. Girolamo Riario retired
within his own little state, and for a time his grand political
schemes remained in abeyance. He had forcible reason to
congratulate himself on being able to retain possession of his
territories, hemmed in on one side by the Pope, Venice and
Florence, and on the other weakened by the dominion of
Faenza, which divided them asunder. At the beginning of
his reign Innocent VIII. showed himself very unfavourable
to Riario. When Lorenzo, through Guid’Antonio Vespucci,
confidentially suggested a project for an undertaking against
him, the Pope appeared to have no objection, but to prefer
to keep aloof himself and let others act for him. The execution
of the project was delayed, partly on account of its
difficulty, for Girolamo was on his guard, and there was a
fear of encroachment from Venice; and also because of the
doubt as to who should be enfeoffed with the two cities.
Later on, the Pope and Florence being in difficulties, the
project was entirely given up.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> When it is remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
that in the lifetime of Sixtus, Lorenzo had made use of
Girolamo’s mediation to procure tokens of favour and even
benefices for his young son,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> this intrigue throws no favourable
light on his character.</p>

<p>During the four following years the lord of Forlì kept on
tolerably terms with the Florentines. The latter had not
forgotten their old grudge against him for the events of
1478 and 1479; and the Count had but one genuine ally&mdash;Lodovico
il Moro, who upheld him, first, on account of the
ties of blood between them; and, secondly, because of his
constant dread of the extension of Florentine sway on the
north side of the Apennines. Confined within a narrow
circle, Girolamo pressed the more heavily on his subjects.
Indulging in splendour and expense when the inexhaustible
funds of Rome were at his command, he still endeavoured to
continue living in the same way; he embellished his two
cities, Forlì and Imola, with many fine buildings, and kept
up a military force far too oppressive for such a small state;
and to cover the expenses of all this he was obliged to have
recourse to levies and imposts, thereby strengthening the
disaffection towards himself, already nourished by the old
attachment to the Ordelaffi, which was not yet extinct in
Forlì, and increased by his harsh arbitrary rule and cruel
punishments. Under such circumstances, it was not difficult
for a people accustomed to deeds of violence and to taking
the law into their own hands, to form a conspiracy. At its
head was Cecco dell’Orso, the captain of the guard, who was
at enmity with the Count on account of arrears of pay and
other private matters, and having been threatened by him,
resolved to be beforehand with him. On April 14, Cecco,
with two accomplices, entered the chamber of the unsuspecting
Riario, and a few minutes afterwards, before the eyes of
his own attendants, threw him from the window into the street
below, a naked, bleeding, still quivering corpse. That was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
signal for a rising. While the people, shouting for liberty,
dragged the corpse through the streets, the murderers
struck down the chief of the municipality as he was hurrying
to the spot, took possession of the wife and three sons
of the Count, and hastened with their followers to the
citadel to take immediate possession of it. But the commandant
declared he would surrender to no one but the
Countess, and not even to her if she were a prisoner. Thus
repulsed at this important point, the heads of the conspiracy
could not attain their object in the city either; for as a
security against betrayal, they had admitted only a few to
share in their secrets. The new ruling family had not many
adherents; some favoured the old dynasty; the majority desired
the direct government of the Church. The Papal
governor of Cesena, Monsignor Savelli, was called upon to
take possession of the city. Without the fortress this
possession was incomplete, and as the negotiations fell to
the ground, Riario’s widow took advantage of the difficulty
and made herself mistress of the situation. Urged by the
prelate and the insurgents to come forward as mediatrix, she
promised, on condition of receiving compensation, to induce
the castellan to surrender if she was allowed to speak to him.
Her sons remained as hostages in the hands of the citizens.
The gates were opened to her, and she raised the standard
of the Sforza. A threat to kill the boys if she did not surrender
was received with a defiant answer. The brave
woman reckoned that every hour’s delay was in her favour,
while the disunion among the opponents strengthened her
hope that they would not proceed to extremities against her
helpless children. She was not mistaken. On all sides
there was a stir. Lodovico il Moro wrote to Florence, appealing
to the Republic to guard the endangered rights of
the sons of Riario. At the same time, without consulting
the allies, he despatched Galeazzo da Sanseverino with horse
and foot, while Giovanni Bentivoglio and Galeotto Pico della
Mirandola set out towards Forlì with numerous troops. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Florentines, as soon as they heard of these military movements,
sent part of the troops which they still kept in the
Lunigiana to the frontiers of Romagna, under the Count of
Pitigliano and Ranuccio Farnese. In Forlì no one knew
what to do. The enemies of Riario hoped for active support
from the Pope; but Innocent, though he caused a few troops
to advance from Cesena, was either unwilling or unable to
take part in their favour.</p>

<p>The heads of the movement turned their eyes to Florence,
well knowing the inward dislike in that city between the
Medici and the Riari. The Ferrarese ambassador wrote
that in Florence nothing had been known of the conspiracy;
but the people rejoiced at the misfortune which had befallen
the Count, and, mindful of the past, were not in a frame of
mind to grieve if in the course of events his family should
be destroyed root and branch. A letter addressed to Lorenzo
by the perpetrators of the deed, four days later, sets forth
their motives and proceedings, as well as the resolve of the
citizens no longer to submit to a single ruler, but to give
themselves up to the Church, on whose assistance they
reckoned. Lorenzo, the letter added, must rejoice at an
event which freed him and the Republic from a crafty foe,
and avenged his innocent brother’s blood; and therefore the
citizens hoped for active support from Florence. There was
nothing, however, to indicate a previous understanding.
Lorenzo sent to Forlì a confidential agent, Stefano da Castrocaro,
who described the circumstances and state of the
city, its confidence in Florentine help, and its idea of remaining
under the direct government of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> From expressions
afterwards used by Lorenzo about this matter, it is
clear that this very inclination of the majority of the people
would have cooled his ardour to help them against the
Riario party, if, indeed, he had ever felt any. Moreover,
the progress of events was more rapid than was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
expected in Florence. Before the twisted threads of propositions
and negotiations could be disentangled, the advance
of the Milanese and Bolognese troops settled the
matter. Those who were most deeply compromised betook
themselves to the neighbouring Florentine territory, and on
April 29, Girolamo’s little son Ottaviano Riario was proclaimed
lord of Forlì and Imola. Caterina Sforza, who assumed
the regency, took bloody vengeance on those
within reach of her hand, for the murder of her husband
and the danger of her children. This affair, however,
brought upon Florence a difficulty which shows how uncertain
were her relations both legal and political. In a
rugged part of the Apennines, north-east of the road from
Florence to Bologna, lies Piancaldoli, now a village of less
than a thousand inhabitants. In the war of 1478, Girolamo
Riario took possession of it, and the Florentines had never
been able to make him give it up. Now they thought the
time had arrived to obtain justice and avenge the insult.
Their troops marching towards Romagna, in the direction of
Imola, received orders to secure Piancaldoli. At this Lodovico
became highly excited, not so much for the sake of the
unimportant town as because he suspected that it might be
the commencement of greater acquisitions. Giovan Pietro
Bergomino, his commissioner with the troops sent against
Forlì, came to high words with the Florentine commissioner
Averardo de’ Medici. Both sides grew so excited
that Ercole d’Este thought it necessary to step between
them. Lorenzo showed not the slightest disposition
to yield. He told the Ferrarese ambassador that things
must be bad indeed if the Republic could not seek to recover
her own property by means of her own people without asking
leave of Milan, which at that very moment had sent her
troops against Forlì without any agreement with Florence,
this being an expedition of far more importance than that
against Piancaldoli, and one which ought to have been
carried out only in alliance with the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Lorenzo’s conversations with the ambassador show the
ill-will and distrust on all sides. He avoided stating plainly
whether the Republic aimed at extending her dominions on
the Romagna side, though it was observed to him that she
would thereby become involved in a disastrous conflict with
Sforza, who regarded the Forlì affairs as his own and
thought his honour at stake in them. Lorenzo only promised
to wait and see how events would develop themselves.
He thought the Pope had the best prospect, as he considered
it impossible that Forlì would again submit to the Riari;
but he did not conceal the fact that a family dynasty,
whether of Riari or any other, seemed to him a less evil than
direct Papal government or an increase of the influence of
the Sforza. Still, the aggrandisement of the latter would
be less injurious than that of the Church, as they would
probably be more willing to confer fiefs in Romagna on
family dynasties, than the Church, which had long treated
her barons with increasing disfavour and would not give up
what she had once secured within her own grasp. The
Church, he once observed, was at present more to be feared
than even Venice, and this had chiefly induced him to support
King Ferrante against the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Such were Lorenzo’s
views at that time, when his chief care was to keep on good
terms with the Pope&mdash;views which were always shared by
the Neapolitan king. Piancaldoli was taken by the Florentines
two days before Forlì came to terms with the Riari.
But a few years after Lorenzo’s death an event happened to
which he was most averse; all the small lordships of
Romagna, whose interests were bound up with those of the
Republic, came to a violent end.</p>

<p>The ill-feeling against Milan remained even after this
vexed question was settled and after Florence, from consideration
for Lodovico, had refused to receive Riario’s
murderers, who thereupon applied to Rome. Lorenzo declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that if the Duke of Bari’s demands were reasonable,
Florence would always be willing to please him, but he must
not come upon her with anything against the honour of the
state; he also begged the Duke of Ferrara not to support
such demands. About this time, towards the middle of
May, he went to the baths, and his representative in politics,
Pier Filippo Pandolfini, replied to Lodovico’s urgent demands
for the restitution of Piancaldoli that it was in vain to ask
for anything against their honour; Florence was no Pavia
or Cremona, where the Duke of Milan could command.
Scarcely had these first vexations passed off when a similar
case occurred in which the Republic became still more
deeply involved. The cause of the dispute this time was
Faenza, the only state yet left to the Manfredi, and to
which, as has been previously described, Florence stood in
the relation of a protecting power. Galeotto Manfredi was
married to Francesca Bentivoglio, one of the many daughters
of the lord of Bologna; and in arranging this marriage
Lorenzo had had a considerable share.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Her husband’s unfaithfulness
excited the passionate woman to such a pitch of
revenge that on May 31, 1488, she had him killed in their
sleeping-chamber by hired assassins. She then, with her
two sons, of whom the eldest was only three years old,
hastened to the citadel and informed her father of what had
been done. Giovanni Bentivoglio lost not a moment. He
set out with the troops collected at the Forlì disturbances,
and sent to Bergomino, the Milanese commissioner who was
still in the latter town, directions to join him. At first all
went well. The lord of Bologna and his troops were peaceably
received in Faenza, and it seemed as if the proclamation
of little Astorre Manfredi would settle everything;
but some disagreement between the inhabitants and the
rude mountaineers of the Lamone valley who had rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
into the town, caused a riot in which the Milanese commissioner
and more than fifty of his men lost their lives, and
Giovanni Bentivoglio saved his own with difficulty. When the
worst of the tumult was put down, Astorre was proclaimed
under the protection of the Republic of Florence, to whose
commissioner Antonio Boscoli the more reasonable of the
two parties had at once applied for mediation and support.</p>

<p>The news from Faenza caused great excitement in
Florence. There was a suspicion abroad that the Milanese
and Bolognese intrigues were at the bottom of the whole
affair, and it was at once resolved to grant the desired protection
both to the people of Faenza and to the young
Manfredi, and to send the desired troops; measures which,
in consideration of the old protecting relation of Florence
to Faenza, could not justly be taken amiss by anyone.
Faenza was occupied; Bentivoglio taken prisoner and transported
to Modigliana, the neighbouring capital of Tuscan
Romagna; Madonna Francesca was sent to her mother at
Bologna; and a regency was established consisting of certain
inhabitants of Faenza and of the Lamone valley. Bentivoglio,
who had only the Florentines to thank for not having
escaped unhurt from the mountaineers, thought it hard that
he was kept in confinement on Florentine ground. Lodovico
Sforza, King Ferrante, and Ercole d’Este all interceded for
his release; his wife was loud in her lamentations, Bolognese
troops assembled on the frontier, and the city of Bologna
sent an embassy to Florence. But Lorenzo, knowing that
the frontiers were sufficiently secured, replied that Messer
Giovanni must have patience till things were settled in
Faenza.</p>

<p>At last the commissioner at Modigliana, Dionigi Pucci,
received orders to release the prisoner and send him to
Cafaggiuolo, where Lorenzo awaited him; this was on June
14. Lorenzo declared himself perfectly satisfied with his
interview with Giovanni, and appeared to believe in a re-establishment
of their former good understanding. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
after a while the lord of Bologna sought to obtain the consent
of Florence for his daughter’s return to Faenza, and at
the same time offered the hand of another daughter for
Giuliano de’ Medici. Both propositions were decisively
refused, at which Bentivoglio was so angry that the Florentines
began to consider Lorenzo’s residence at Poggio a
Cajano unsafe, as the villa lay exposed to a raid from
Bologna. Lorenzo himself was uneasy though he tried to
hide it. When Giovanni appealed to him to procure the
Pope’s absolution for Madonna Francesca that she might
either marry again or enter a convent, he fulfilled the request
in the hope of making friends again. His letter to Innocent
VIII.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> reminding him of the willingness he had displayed,
proves that he was anxious about the matter. He
‘most earnestly besought,’ he said, ‘these tokens of favour.’</p>

<p>A good understanding was soon established with Caterina
Riario Sforza; Lorenzo endeavoured not only to thwart the
attempts of the Ordelaffi and their party against her, but
also to arrange a betrothal between her daughter and the
young Manfredi, whom the Republic regarded and treated
as a ward of its own.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> So bad was the state of affairs in
Romagna, especially in Faenza; so great was the insecurity
caused by the enmity between families and individuals, and
increased by political disturbances; and so powerless to
secure lasting quiet were the efforts to procure peace and
reconciliation made on the part of the Church, after the
precedent of S. Bernardino of Siena and others before and
after him, that the Florentine influence was doubly needed
in these small states as a softening element for a people
difficult to control, and as a support for their rulers. It
was Lorenzo who protected the interests of Astorre Manfredi
when Cotignola, the home and countship of the Sforza, tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to extend its little territory at the expense of Faenza. At
the end of 1489 Giovanni Bentivoglio made another attempt
to procure his daughter’s return to the last-named city. ‘I
have never,’ he wrote to Lorenzo,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> ‘striven for this return,
nor do I strive for it now, without the approval of your
Magnificence; for in this, as in all my affairs, I wish only
to act in accordance with your benevolent and wise counsels,
as beseems our old friendship and brotherhood.’ That
Francesca should return and undertake the guidance of her
son he considered the only means of putting an end to the
confusion, but he would do nothing without Lorenzo.</p>

<p>These disturbances in Romagna were the last during
Lorenzo’s lifetime in which there occurred political and
military interference in the affairs of neighbouring states,
and which threatened to create complications with other
powers. But the southern side of the Apennines was not
altogether quiet. It is a strange but undeniable fact that
the man whose efforts in general were directed to preserve
peace and secure political equilibrium could not always resist
the temptation of forging intrigues against little neighbouring
states, and employing restless, discontented parties for
this purpose. He must have been urged on by that thirst
for aggrandisement which was an inheritance of the Republic
and the Medici as well as of Venice and of the Visconti.
The fine words about union and brotherhood were belied in
action. Lorenzo was, indeed, too prudent and cautious to
be easily caught by foreign bait; but he only kept out of a
thing when it seemed to him unprofitable or dangerous to
himself. In March 1488, Franceschetto Cybò tried to draw
him into an attempt against Jacopo IV. Appiani, who had
long been quarrelling with Rome; in this attempt he hoped
also to gain the support of Ferrante, thinking that the latter
would gladly seize an opportunity of reconciliation with the
Pope. Lorenzo showed no disposition for the undertaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
If Piombino could not be won for Florence, he naturally preferred
to see it in the hands of a petty native lord rather
than in those of the Pope, even if the latter was willing to
give it to his son, which was not certain; and he did not at
all want to push the King of Naples into Tuscan affairs.
He well remembered having heard how the king’s father
had said in 1448 that if he took Piombino he hoped to get
possession of all Tuscany; words which he recalled to the
remembrance of the Sienese, who held the little state under
their protection, when he sought to inspire them with a
good opinion of his friendly and neighbourly views.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But
towards Siena herself his policy was anything but straightforward.
Internal disquietude had never ceased in that
city, and was paving the way for a government similar to
that of Florence, only that the rising families of Siena&mdash;the
Petrucci and Piccolomini&mdash;could not succeed in gaining a
firm footing like the Medici, and the fickleness of the people
and the nobility, violently at strife among themselves, far
outdid that of the Florentines. The party among the
nobility once supported by Alfonso of Calabria returned from
exile in 1487, and brought about an apparently sweeping
change in the constitution; raising the old classes, or Monti,
long degenerated into hostile and exclusive parties, and
extending eligibility for office to all sections of the community.
This change in the constitution was hailed and
joyously celebrated as the restoration of harmony; but it
was not long before the reforming faction, who had hitherto
ruled, discovered that they were getting the worst of it at
the elections, and that all the authority was passing into the
hands of their opponents. Dissatisfied with this, they secretly
applied to Lorenzo; and he, who not long before had assured
the sister-Republic of his warm interest in the preservation of
peace, now showed himself disposed to help the malcontents
to regain their former position. In March 1488 he caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
troops to advance towards Arezzo and the Chiana valley,
and himself proceeded to the former place. But the Sienese
got scent of the affair, arrested a number of suspected persons,
banished those most deeply compromised, and sent
Messer Niccolò Borghese to Arezzo to demand an explanation
from Lorenzo. The latter, thus learning that the
project was discovered, found out at the same time that the
Pope, on whose aid he had seemingly reckoned, had no mind
to be mixed up in the scheme, and had prevented his son
from going to see his father-in-law. Naples, however, was
ready to support her old friends at Siena. Altogether,
Lorenzo thought it best openly to avow his intention of helping
the reforming party to regain their rightful position.
The ruling party in the city, excited by repeated disturbances
in the district, caused by the Orsini of Pitigliano and by the
exiles, fortified their frontiers and pressed harder than ever
on their opponents. A rupture with Florence was, however,
avoided. Lorenzo did not attain his object, but it is clear
from his conduct that he was anxious to keep on good terms
with his neighbours. In this he succeeded. His envoys
were well received at Siena, and whenever he himself came
to the city, or within its dominions, he was always most
honourably received and loaded with presents. He was probably
of the same mind as Franceschetto Cybò, who once
wrote to him that Siena was a very rich morsel.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The state
of friendly and neighbourly relations between them may be
judged from the fact that, on account of a frontier dispute,
the Florentine Signoria once had thoughts of making the
high road through Siena to Rome practically impassable by
imposing an utterly preposterous frontier-toll of one gold
florin for every foot-passenger, two for every horseman, and
five for every mule.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Little more than a year after these matters Lorenzo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
again, outwardly at least, on such good terms with the
Sienese Signoria that he could appeal to them for mercy on
one of their imprisoned and condemned rebels: ‘I know
well, my Lords,’ are his words, ‘how serious a matter for the
state is a crime like that in question; but, on the other
hand, I consider what merit before God and praise from
man is gained by those who show mercy and pity towards
such delinquents, provided the common weal is not thereby
endangered. I would earnestly beg your Lordships, now
that the safety of the state seems ensured, to show mercy to
Messer Maurizio.’ When Lorenzo wrote thus he apparently
forgot that five months before he had acted in a manner not
exactly in accordance with these words and sentiments. A
young man had killed an official of the Eight in a quarrel,
fled to Siena, was from thence delivered up, and condemned
to death. When he was led to the place of execution the
people pitied him and shouted: ‘Fly! fly!’ and tried to
free him from the attendant officers. Lorenzo was then in
the palace. The foreign ambassadors and several of the
youth’s relations begged him to procure the prisoner’s pardon.
He put them off with words, caused the culprit to be hung
at a window of the Palace of Justice, and four of the rioters
to be seized, scourged, and banished from the city for several
years. He did not return home till the tumult was completely
put down;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> he feared the slightest attempt to create
disorder in the city, being perfectly aware of the inflammable
material it contained.</p>

<p>The Florentine policy was ambiguous towards the Sienese,
as also in relation to Lucca. Reciprocal distrust and ill-will
showed itself in many ways, and no blame can be attached
to the far weaker Lucchese that they were on their guard.
The dispute about Pietrasanta was never really settled, and
when a money-compensation to Lucca came to be discussed
the two parties could not agree as to the amount. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
end of March 1490, a plot was discovered whose only possible
object was to betray Lucca into the hands of the
Florentines, and in it a factor of the Medici appeared to be
concerned. This occasioned a correspondence between the
Anziani and Lorenzo, in which, despite all formal politeness
and caution, the want of confidence was but too clearly
shown. The Lucchese opinion of Florentine friendship was
expressed, far more truly than in letters and embassies, by
the trenches and ramparts with which they surrounded their
unfortified places.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>In Umbria and the Marches, too, Florentine interests
were at stake, and Soderini, the ambassador to King Ferrante,
was right in pointing out how anxious the Republic
was to prevent any disturbance of the existing circumstances
in Bologna, Perugia, Città di Castello, Faenza, or Siena,
just as much as in her own state, and what large sums of
money she expended with this object. Franceschetto Cybò,
who was always on the look-out for something, would fain
have made himself master of Città di Castello, and represented
to Lorenzo that this was desired by both the factions&mdash;the
Vitelli and the Giustini&mdash;who kept each other in check
under a Papal governor. But Lorenzo was evidently not
disposed to allow his son-in-law to have his will. Perugia
was in constant excitement from the restless character of its
citizens, culminating in a perpetual strife between the two
most powerful families&mdash;the Baglioni and the Oddi&mdash;which
filled the chief city of Umbria with tumults; day after day
scenes of bloodshed occurred, and first one party and then
the other was driven into exile. The Pope’s brother,
Maurizio Cybò, a brave and sensible man, to whom the
government was entrusted in February 1488, vainly attempted
to restore peace and order between the disputants. A citation
of the heads of the parties to Rome had no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
success; several positively refused to go, and though a reconciliation
did take place in consequence of the citation, it
was not lasting. Quiet was restored for a time by a general
prohibition of the use of arms, but the strife soon broke out
again.</p>

<p>When Franceschetto Cybò was in Perugia in July 1488,
with a Papal commission to act as peacemaker,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> many
citizens came to him with complaints of the intolerable state
of the city. They declared that right and justice had lost
all power, and begged him to give his assistance in putting
an end to the evil. Franceschetto was not lacking in goodwill;
but to cure such a moral cancer required a different
sort of man, and the result justified the opinion expressed
by Lorenzo in a letter to Lanfredini when this difficult
mission was conferred by the Pope on his son. Franceschetto’s
deliberations with the representatives of the great
families, and the remonstrances made in Rome to divers
noble Perugians, were all equally vain. At the end of
October there was a bloody fight in and around the square
before the palace of the Priori; small artillery was actually
employed, houses were set on fire, the cathedral of San
Lorenzo was used as a fortress, and barricades were constructed.
Throughout the next day the street-fighting
continued, with plundering and burning, and the prisons
were broken open. The governor, who came back when the
tumult was at its height, was received with shouts of
‘Church! Church!’ and notwithstanding all he could do
his influence was powerless to quell the disturbance. At
last the Oddi were beaten and forced to leave the city and
flee to Castiglione del Lago (on Trasimene), where they and
their numerous adherents set up a camp. The fight threatened
to spread over the whole neighbouring country, as most
of the fortresses belonged to the nobility; Spello, Fuligno,
and other important places were already in arms and at open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
war with each other, the Vitelli, Orsini, and others taking
part in the contest.</p>

<p>From the time of the Pazzi disturbances Lorenzo had
had so much to do with Perugia, and so clearly recognised
the importance of that city to Florence, that he was most
anxious to put an end to this boundless disorder, the result
of which would tend to weaken even the victorious party.
He sided with the Baglioni, who had, moreover, sent one of
their number to him. Maurizio Cybò declined to stay any
longer at Perugia, whereupon Innocent appointed Francesco
Todeschini Piccolomini, Cardinal of Siena, to be legate. On
his arrival on November 16, 1488, Lorenzo tried to persuade
him to declare for the Baglioni party and to further their
interests; not merely with the object of securing their supremacy
in Perugia with the Pope’s consent, but also to keep
them from forming a closer connection with Ferrante. They
were already in communication with that king, to the displeasure
of Lorenzo, who hated all Neapolitan meddling in
the affairs of central Italy. ‘The Baglioni,’ he wrote to
Lanfredini, ‘would give themselves not merely to the king,
but to the devil. Therefore I hold that all possible efforts
must be made to extinguish this flame. Believe me, if the
Pope uses this opportunity he will bring over the Baglioni
completely to his own side, and be able to make them serviceable
for his own ends. It would be well to tell the legate
to deal with the exiles as he thinks good; I will then endeavour
myself to induce the Baglioni to submit to the
legate’s will. At all events, some cure for this wound is
necessary.’ The Count of Pitigliano had already headed
some Florentine troops against the Oddi. Cardinal Piccolomini
was apparently not clearly convinced which party was
right and which was wrong, and he was not inclined to be
the tool of either. For a long time he withstood repeated
persuasions to pronounce sentence of banishment on the
exiles, urged upon him by the Baglioni in unison with the
commissioners of Florence and Urbino, of the Orsini and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the Vitelli; Lorenzo had sent Messer Niccolò Vettori. At
last the legate saw things could no longer remain in suspense;
so he caused the heads of the ruling party to swear
on the Gospels that they would keep the city in obedience
to the Pope, lay down their arms, not hinder the course of
justice, and hand over to his people the places they occupied
in the district. Then on January 22, 1489, he confirmed
the privileges of the city and issued a decree of banishment
against the exiles, confining them for the next five years to
various places in Tuscany, Romagna, and the Marches,
under pain of outlawry if they left these appointed places.</p>

<p>All this was done with the participation of the commissioners,
who thereupon took leave, after a state dinner given
them by the Signoria. The next thing was the election of
the magistrates; the troops of the legate, two hundred and
fifty men, occupied the city and its environs; the decree of
banishment was posted up at the Cathedral and the palace
of the Podestà, and the chief persons concerned were informed
of it by an executor of the commonwealth. When
this official came to one of the heads of the Oddi party,
Agamemnone della Penna, who was at Castiglioncello on
the Urbino frontier, he closed the doors, drew his dagger
and said to the messenger: ‘Take your choice; either
swallow the decree, or I will kill you.’ The man did not
take long to consider. Agamemnone took from him the
papers destined for the other exiles, most of whom were at
Gubbio, close by, and sent him back with this pleasant intelligence
to Perugia. The feud, in which the Florentines
were not idle, began again in the district; but neither the
fighting nor the efforts at mediation repeatedly made by the
legate, who kept wandering from one place to another,
brought about a decision. In the city, except for a few occasional
disturbances, peace was in some degree restored,
while all power was in the hands of the Baglioni, who for a
long time refused to let any foreign mediation persuade them
to a reconciliation with their adversaries. In June 1491<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
however an attack on the city and fresh scenes of bloodshed
obliged them to come to terms as soon as possible. Lorenzo,
who had greatly contributed to the victory of the Baglioni
through Lanfredini’s negotiations with the Pope and Vettori’s
mediation in Perugia, and who was anxious that the
Holy See should keep only a nominal authority in the latter
city, could not help perceiving how difficult it was to restore
to even the smallest degree of legal order a city torn by such
wild passions and suffering under such unfortunate circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Of less importance to the Florentines than the affairs of
Perugia were the disturbances at Ascoli near the Neapolitan
frontier. On account of its position, commanding the high
road from the valley of the Tronto towards Umbria, the state
of this town was not a matter of indifference to the Republic.
The quarrels in which from 1484 onwards it was involved
with Fermo and other neighbouring places attracted considerable
attention from the fact that on one side the Pope,
and on the other King Ferrante, were drawn into them, and
the lords of Urbino and Camerino found themselves obliged
to interfere both for the sake of their own states and on
account of their relations with Rome. These quarrels,
which with short intervals of peace were perpetually recommencing,
and did frightful damage to the smaller places
and the unprotected country, had been profitable to some,
amongst whom was Boccalino of Osimo, who had many connections
in the Marches of Fermo. In 1487 Cardinal della
Rovere vainly tried to make peace between Ascoli and
Fermo. The strife was so furious that in an attack made
by the Ascolani in April of that year on the fortress of
Acquaviva, sixty men who had entered a building by
treachery were burnt in it, and those who hurried to their
assistance were slaughtered in the moat. Not long after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
this the Ascolans attacked Offida, which lay between them
and the sea, drove out the vice-legate of the March, plundered,
burned and murdered all and whomsoever came in
their way, and repulsed the troops of Urbino which had
marched to the rescue. Rome saw the need of putting an
end to this anarchy, and entered into negotiations with the
lords of Urbino and Camerino to overcome the resistance
of Ascoli. But the Florentines, and still more the King of
Naples, although they earnestly wished for peace on the
Adriatic shores, were not willing that the Pope’s authority
should be strengthened in that quarter. ‘The king,’ wrote
Piero Nasi, Florentine ambassador at Naples, to Lorenzo,
‘is very anxious that the Pope should not get possession of
Ascoli; for he sees that should this occur, the connection
between himself and us will be for ever cut off. As we have
managed to prevent the Pope from making himself lord of
Perugia, so his Majesty’s power should suffice to compass
the same at Ascoli.’</p>

<p>Thus, in this so-called time of peace, there was strife and
disorder, mistrust and selfishness, on all sides. Ferrante
thought little enough of Florentine interests, in his unwillingness
to let Innocent gain a firm footing on his own
border. Even in Lorenzo’s last year of rule these disputes
in the Marches were not settled. It was Cesare Borgia who
first made peace here, as he did in Romagna, after his own
fashion.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Cares and troubles overtook De’ Medici from
another quarter. He was bound to the Orsini by other
chains than family ties; the attitude taken by this old and
powerful family towards the Popes, Naples, Siena, and
Florence claimed his attention. The Orsini flattered themselves
they were sovereign lords. So great was the number
and importance of their possessions in the neighbourhood of
Rome that they might well cause uneasiness to a stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
government than that of most of the Popes; and the only
thing that tended to neutralise their power was their almost
ceaseless strife with the Colonna, who, however, at this present
time were no match for them. Their numerous fiefs in
the kingdom of Naples brought them into close connection
with its rulers. Since the beginning of the fourteenth century
they had held, through inheritance from a branch of
the Teutonic dynasty of the Aldobrandeschi, the county of
Sorano-Pitigliano, between the Patrimonium Petri and the
Sienese territory; and they kept their neighbours in constant
uneasiness by the disordered state of affairs there,
caused by the constant disagreement between the members
of the family, not likely by any means to be softened by the
protectorate (<i>accomandigia</i>) of Siena, herself in a state of
great unrest.</p>

<p>We have pointed out how much depended on the attitude
of the Orsini in the days of the quarrel between Innocent
and Ferrante. The relations of the most powerful of
the family, Gentil Virginio, lord of Bracciano, with the
Pope and the king, gave Lorenzo constant occupation, as is
testified by his correspondence with the ambassadors in
Rome and Naples. ‘Should his Holiness proceed in the
manner suggested,’ he wrote to Lanfredini on March 24,
1489,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> when Innocent for a moment thought of arresting
Gentil Virginio for his suspicious conduct amid the Neapolitan
troubles&mdash;‘he would thereby gain nothing, save that
the whole family would unite and be a prize for the king.
If the Pope answers that this will happen in any case, I
reply that it is far better that it should happen without our
having a hand in it, than that we should give them ground
for laying the blame on us. The minds and wills of these
lords Orsini never agree. They cannot keep together well,
and you will see when the king most needs them they will
serve him worst, for they are ambitious and greedy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
except when need compels them there is no constancy in
them.’ In later days Ferrante once remarked that lord
Virginio was naturally very obstinate when he had made up
his mind to a thing, especially if he thought himself in the
right;<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> it may therefore be imagined how much trouble
Lorenzo had in controlling a man whom his position in
Rome, his rank as Neapolitan general, his experience in warfare,
and his great landed property rendered more powerful
than many princes. He always remained on good terms
with the Medici personally. Niccolò, Count of Pitigliano
and Nola, was, as has been seen, closely connected with the
Republic. But even with this naturally prudent man there
arose some difficulties whenever his interests or inclinations
as chief of a family clashed with his position as general of a
greater state. He too, like all the warriors of the time,
though his personal valour and honour are unstained, contributed
to display the corruption of the military science of
the time, and the incompatibility of the prevalent mercenary
system with the advantage and security of the state.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FLORENTINE STATE; PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND FINANCES
ABOUT 1490.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> reform in the constitution made in the summer of 1480,
whereby the decisive part in the affairs of the State was
concentrated in the Council of Seventy, had now held its
ground for ten years. These ten years, added to the fifty
during which the house of Medici had risen to the head of
the State, necessarily excluded all families which maintained
not only a hostile, but even an independent position.
Amongst the ruling portion of the aristocracy, including
many popular but not therefore liberal elements, there were
men who, in their hearts, detested both the system and its
most illustrious supporter; but the majority were attached
to it both from interest or from necessity. Others silently
accepted what they could not alter without resorting to a
great revolution and outward shock which, doubtless, few
desired. The lower classes were so much influenced by the
arts of those in power, and the governments preceding that
of the Medici had oppressed them to such an extent, popular
revolutions had been of so tumultuous a character, and had
always so speedily paved the way for despotism, that there
could be no serious thought of change. The upper class of
citizens, who had a share in the government in the wider
sense, who were represented in the councils and admitted
to office, contented themselves with the measure and appearance
of authority, influence, and other advantages given
them by the constitution. All the hostile families of rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
were ruined by exile, confiscation, and taxes; their old
chiefs were either dead or in banishment, they had completely
lost their influence and were no longer to be feared;
or they had allowed themselves to be gained over in one
way or another, and now acted in concert with their former
opponents.</p>

<p>According to the time of their fall these families may be
divided into three groups: the Albizzi and their adherents
fell in 1434, the partisans of Diotisalvi Neroni in 1466, the
Pazzi in 1478. Lorenzo had no need to trouble himself
about any of them. In the first part of this history we
pointed out the extent of the misery into which the Albizzi
of Messer Rinaldo’s line had sunk. Forty-four years after
their banishment the rights of citizenship were restored to
Alessandro, a great-grandson of the former head of the
Republic, for having, when far away from Florence during
the war which broke out after the Pazzi conspiracy, discovered
to the Signoria a plot whereby the town of Pistoja
was to be betrayed into the hands of the Duke of Urbino.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
The descendants of Rinaldo’s brothers remained friendly to
the Medici. The Neroni party were become powerless since
the Colleone affair. Piero de’ Medici himself had some idea
of becoming reconciled with Agnolo Acciaiuolo, more than
one of whose relatives were among his own warmest adherents;
so the disunion was not likely to continue between
their posterity. But for the Pazzi affair Agnolo’s descendants,
favoured by the Aragonese, would doubtless have been
taken back into favour long before 1482. The enmity
between the Medici and the Soderini ended with the death
of Niccolò Soderini in 1474, though it came to life again
later under different circumstances in the sons of that Tommaso
who was so closely connected with Piero and Lorenzo.
The Pazzi were thoroughly put out of the way; the scaffold
and the prison of Volterra swallowed up both guilty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
guiltless; and even when, in consequence of agreements
with the Pope and Naples, the survivors were set free in
1482, they were still subjected to many restraints which
lasted till the revolution of 1494. Lorenzo’s brother-in-law,
Guglielmo, after a long confinement in a house in the
country, was sent to Faenza, where Galeotto Manfredi kept
him in custody at Lorenzo’s disposal, as is shown by a letter
of Galeotto’s dated February 25, 1483. Three days later he
received orders for the liberation of his prisoner, and this
decision was announced by Lorenzo to his sister Bianca,
who had remained in Florence, and to his brother-in-law
himself. In the autumn of the following year Guglielmo
was in Rome, and in friendly intercourse with the Medici
and Bernardo Rucellai.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> After the revolution of 1494 he
was re-admitted to political offices; but he showed little
capacity for the work, and his son Alessandro (eleven years
old when his uncle Lorenzo died), notwithstanding his
sagacity and experience, was better fitted for scholarly work
than for public life. Of the other families who arrayed
themselves against the Medici in the attack before referred
to, some never again played any important part in politics;
others let themselves be chained to the victor’s chariot.
Thus it was with the Peruzzi, the Gianfigliazzi, the Pitti,
and others. The first-named&mdash;old, rich, and illustrious&mdash;were
excluded from office after the return of Cosimo de’
Medici. The two branches of the Strozzi, whose influence
had formerly been considerable, were now in some degree
estranged, and the most famous of the two was just rising
to the height of its splendour.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, as he looked around him, had no need to fear
the recurrence of such opposition as had endangered the
authority of his grandfather and father. There seemed no
room for even attempts at violence, and the tendencies
which sprang forth after his death were at this time hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
perceptible even in the germ. Francesco Guicciardini described
the situation in a few sentences: ‘The city was in
perfect peace. The citizens in whose hands was the administration
held firmly together; the government, carried
on and supported by them, was so powerful that no one
dared contradict it. The people were daily entertained with
festivals, spectacles, and novelties; to their profit the city
abounded in everything; trade and business were at the
height of prosperity. Men of talent found their proper place
in the great liberality with which the arts and sciences were
promoted and those who practised them were honoured.
This city, quiet and peaceful at home, enjoyed also high
esteem and great consideration abroad, because she had a
government whose head had full authority; because her
dominions had lately been extended; because the deliverance
of Ferrara and that of King Ferrante were mainly
owing to her; because she had complete sway over Pope
Innocent; and because, in alliance with Naples and Milan,
she in some measure kept all Italy in equilibrium.’</p>

<p>Amid this happy state of things, however, symptoms
showed themselves which decidedly pointed out something
insecure in the foundations. From a moral point of view
there were drawbacks whose influence on the general development
and final determination of affairs was inevitable.
Anyone who looked below the glittering surface must have
felt yearly increasing care about the political situation.
Putting aside foreign politics, the home affairs gave extra
cause for anxiety. It was becoming more and more evident
that everything, present and future, depended on one man
alone. It could hardly therefore go unperceived that the
necessary consequences of this man’s position and career
furnished a prospect, perhaps not a distant one, of a radical
change in the constitution.</p>

<p>Alessandro de’ Pazzi graphically described the difficulties
of his uncle’s position:<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> ‘When Lorenzo came to the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the party after Piero’s death he found a serious task
before him, and, young as he was, he had need of great
prudence to keep together and govern this party; so much
the more because the citizens who were then powerful
thought they could retain their commanding position, without
allowing Lorenzo to usurp the same authority that his
grandfather and father had enjoyed. In my opinion this
was a mistake; discord would soon have parted them. But
his exertions were great, and it was owing to him that no
division occurred at that time. His patience with his adherents
deserves as much praise as his prudence, activity, and
liberality; and I know from my mother that in these first
years he thought day and night of nothing but gaining over
his friends for his own objects.’</p>

<p>Again, after referring to the dangers and consequences
of the years 1478-1480, he says: ‘By dint of skill and
luck, without which nothing is to be attained in human
affairs, he consolidated his position and maintained it all
his life long, not merely as his grandfather had done,
but a step higher and with fuller powers. He was in
more danger than Cosimo, but he stood so high that the
danger was outweighed. Nevertheless, with all his good
fortune and the favour of circumstances, with his superhuman
intellect and his great number of trustworthy
friends, he gave himself an immense deal of trouble. He
went to work with the greatest caution, with many arts and
secret allies who knew nothing of each other, with inexhaustible
patience and endurance. He was assisted, moreover,
by his wonderfully acute judgment of foreign affairs,
which he understood how to direct and balance better than
any other living man in Italy. Herein also fortune favoured
him, that he lived at a time when forces were more equally
divided than usual, and there was little danger of foreign
interference. Above all it was a happy circumstance that
Cosimo had preceded him as founder of the position of the
family, and for many years past no other and in some sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
no more popular form of government had been known in
Florence. His merits, however, were his own; vigilance,
patience, perseverance, splendour combined with elegance,
whereby he made himself a great name among the Italian
princes and in other lands, while at home he attracted and
gained over all to himself. This also is to be highly esteemed
in him, that he influenced his friends into moderation and
kept their hands clean, so that it may be said that, with a
few exceptions, there occurred no cases of rapine. In truth
he directed the State and his party in the best manner possible
under the circumstances. With all his good fortune
and his uncommon qualities, however, it cost him great
exertions, for he never spared himself, but took a personal
share in all that occurred, whether in the square or in the
palace.’</p>

<p>Although business was transacted not in the house of
Medici but in the palace of the Signoria, where Lorenzo
passed many hours as a member of councils and committees,
still the government was becoming more and more a personal
one. The constant change in the members of the
Signoria, intended to prevent the authority of individuals
from increasing, necessarily promoted this personal government;
so much the more as a regular and consistent treatment
became necessary for the direction of foreign affairs,
ever increasing in continuity and importance. Only in this
manner could Florence maintain her position against the
larger Italian and foreign states&mdash;all monarchic except
Venice, who preserved her constitution almost unchanged.
Naturally, however, such a personal government had the
grave defects of all political arrangements where legal right
and hereditary prescription are not the fundamental principles,
and whose internal nature is a negation of their
external form. This State, apparently constituted on a
broad basis, was in reality ruled by a comparatively small
party with a recognised chief at their head. Lorenzo’s contemporaries
said that he had greater authority and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
personal power than any despotic ruler.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Nothing was done
without his initiative and approval. Popes, kings, and
princes applied to him; ambassadors corresponded with
him; thousands besieged him with petitions for offices,
posts of honour, favours, remission of taxes and imposts,
and personal interests of all kinds both at home and in the
neighbouring states. Each found him willing to listen;
the letters he wrote were innumerable, many of them written
by his own hand, to different parties of high and low rank,
some personally known to him, others quite strangers. He
would willingly help merchants, stewards, farmers, countrymen,
and people of all sorts and positions in life. Besides
the countless clients of the family there were those recommended
by them&mdash;as he called them, ‘my good old
friends.’ He applied to the Duke of Ferrara on behalf of
the money-changers in the Prato, ‘these Jews, my friends.’<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
His correspondence contains the strangest medley of subjects,
events, and persons; contraventions of the toll-regulations
at the passage of the flocks coming down for the
winter from the Casentino and the Pistojan hills to the
Sienese Maremma; frauds by merchants; thefts from
Florentine subjects; differences with the administration of
salt; deeds of violence and murder, are all mixed up with
recommendations for judicial offices, especially the office of
Podestà, judge of the court of appeal, capitano, &amp;c., and for
spiritual dignities and benefices; settlement of boundary
disputes; concessions about the corn trade; mediation on
the passage of troops; and the affairs of the petty dynasties
seated around the Siena district, the Sforzas of Santafiora,
the Orsini of Pitigliano, and many others. His constant
desire was to oblige as many as possible at home and abroad,
and to have the influence of his personal position felt and
understood on all sides.</p>

<p>This position was becoming year by year very glaringly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
exceptional, not only to the eyes of foreign sovereigns but to
those of Italian princes as well. The authority which
Lorenzo was believed to possess with Innocent VIII.,
‘because,’ as he wrote to Lanfredini on August 26, 1489,
‘I am extremely devoted to his Holiness and obliged to him
for many favours,’ caused him to be applied to by all parties
whenever a petition to Rome was to be presented. Almost
simultaneously Guid’Antonio Arcimboldo begged his recommendation
to obtain the archbishopric of Milan, and the
Duke of Britanny sent a messenger to request his support
for the nomination of one of the Duke’s secretaries to the
see of Nantes. Lodovico il Moro applied to him to procure
the Sienese bishopric of Pienza, and Charles, Duke of Savoy,
to have his uncle&mdash;that Francis so well known in connection
with the episcopal troubles at Geneva&mdash;advanced to the
cardinalate. When Federigo Sanseverino, Monsignor de’ Grassi,
the Archbishop of Auch, and others desired the
cardinal’s hat, he was asked to help them to procure it. It
was he who recommended to the Pope the young Alessandro
Farnese, who in 1489 was studying at Pisa and sought to
obtain one of the posts of Apostolic Secretary created by
Innocent at the end of 1487. ‘I wish you to know,’ wrote
Lorenzo to Lanfredini on April 10,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> ‘that this gentleman,
besides coming of such a noble family (<i>oltre allo esser nato
della casa che è</i>) has many distinguished qualities, among
them unusual learning and excellent morals, being at once
very accomplished and a model of virtuous conduct. For
these reasons, the weight of which with me you know, I
recommend him to you as if he were my own son, and beg
you to present him to his Holiness, for which I shall be very
grateful.’ This is perhaps the first testimony, and certainly
a most honourable one, on behalf of Pomponio Leto’s former
pupil, then one-and-twenty, and destined forty-five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
later to succeed a Medici on the Papal throne. When the
Duke of Ferrara and the lord of Camerino wanted help at
Rome, they applied to Lorenzo; when the Duke of Savoy
sent an ambassador thither, he recommended him to Lorenzo.
King John of Portugal wrote from Santarem, Charles VIII.
from Amboise, the Duchess Blanche from Savoy, Anne de
Beaujeu and her husband Pierre de Bourbon from Moulins,
to the ‘Seigneur Laurens.’ His friendly relations with
Matthias Corvinus have been repeatedly mentioned; they
seem to have been none the worse for the fact that Matthias
was for a long time on bad terms with the Sforza, having,
for the sake of his brother-in-law Don Federigo of Aragon,
accepted among the conditions of the treaty with Kaiser
Frederic in 1477 the proceedings against the ruling house
of Milan, which was not recognised by the Empire. To the
Pope Lorenzo often commended his own subjects, as, for
instance, Giovanni Savelli, ‘to whom I have especial goodwill
because he is in the service of our army, and to whom I
am bound by a friendship of many years’ standing,’ and the
distinguished priest Francesco de’ Massimi. Everyone considered
a matter secured in Rome if once Lorenzo took it in
hand; and perhaps the secret of his great success in many
things arose from the shrewdness of his calculation as to
what lay within the limits of possibility.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was surrounded by numerous friends and adherents,
some of whom had inherited distinction, while others
had been raised by him. It was only by their help that he
could maintain his position at home and keep up his connections
abroad. He was well and skilfully supported by
the Acciaiuoli, the Pandolfini, the Vespucci, the Soderini,
the Pucci, the Guicciardini, the Capponi, the Vettori, the
Lanfredini, the Alamanni, the Ridolfi, the Gaddi, &amp;c. They
and their families had a corresponding share in the administration,
in honours and privileges, and held a prominent
position; the consequence of which was that when circumstances
were altered there remained a powerful Medicean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
party which at last gained the victory through external
political circumstances; for the family which had risen
to greatness with their support naturally seized the lion’s
share. But Lorenzo, while advancing his adherents in
power, never allowed them to become too independent of him.
For this purpose the means he chiefly employed was that
of placing on the same level with citizens who had long been
great others who had risen solely by help of the Medici;
in matters which required entire devotion to his interests he
rather gave a preference to the latter. The most active and
influential of the Florentine diplomatists, Giovanni Lanfredini,
sprung from a family originally Roman and which
became extinct in the last century in the person of a cardinal,
had become a business-partner of the Medici as early as
Cosimo’s time. Lorenzo’s policy was to let one person keep
another in check. He was probably suspicious by nature, a
quality which developed as years went on, for he often employed
the chancery-officers who accompanied the ambassadors
to Rome, Naples, and Milan to send him special
reports,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> while his creatures in Florence, especially Ser
Piero of Bibiena and Piero Michelozzi, kept up a correspondence
in various other quarters. We have remarked before
that Bartolommeo Scala, the chancellor of the Signoria, was
in very intimate relations with him. The chancellors of the
other government offices, the only really stable officials in
whom the traditions of business survived, were all in his
interest, most of them having attained their influential posts
through him. Thus he let no family and no individual gain
an influence inconvenient to himself, and kept his eyes on all.
He even meddled in family affairs: hindered marriages if
they seemed to him dangerous, furthered them if he thought
them likely to prove useful. Those whom some special circumstances
had unusually elevated, even when he himself
profited thereby, he always kept in check; as exemplified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the case of Tommaso Soderini, and, after the Pazzi conspiracy,
Girolamo Morelli. Of the former, indeed, there is
nothing more to add, save that he was a member of the
Council of Seventy and died as Capitano at Pisa in 1485.
Lorenzo overlooked many things in his adherents, but he
kept them under his control and took care that they should
feel that their position and advantages were derived from
him. A man who was, indeed, ill-disposed towards him on
account of an event which concerned his family, remarked:<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
‘The great citizens raised and supported Lorenzo in his
youth; in later years he would not have as companions, but
used as servants, those who had been like fathers to him.’</p>

<p>The event alluded to is characteristic of the political
power and position of Lorenzo with regard to the official
representatives of the State. It made no difference to him
if the man on whom his resentment fell<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> had his cause defended
by others in power. When Neri Cambi degli Opportuni
was Gonfaloniere in 1488, and at the end of the year the
Signoria were to be elected for the following January and
February, it was found that the legal number of members
of the colleges was not complete, many having absented
themselves without leave and gone to the chase. To the
great irritation of the people assembled in the square the
election could not take place till one of the missing members
was fetched from his country-house, from whence he came
booted and spurred to the palace, and the election then proceeded.
Indignant at what had occurred, the outgoing
Signoria determined to punish the delinquents, and condemned
four of them to exclusion from office for four years.
Lorenzo was in Pisa at the time. ‘To him,’ says Guicciardini,
‘and to all the heads of the party it was a very disagreeable
affair; for it seemed to them that if a Signoria
could use the right of <i>ammonire</i> without previous deliberation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
with those in power, their own government was hanging
in the air by a thread (<i>lo stato loro fussi a cavallo in su uno
baleno</i>), and they might one fine morning be driven out of
Florence by only six beans (votes). So, after that Signoria
had gone out of office, the matter was again brought up
before the Magistracy of Eight and the Council of Seventy;
the decree against the four citizens was revoked, and Neri
Cambi was declared ineligible for office for the rest of his
life. The council was by no means unanimous, but Lorenzo’s
will carried the day.’</p>

<p>This was a pretty clear token of how matters stood with
regard to the powers of the supreme court. But this was
not all; participation in the government was to be yet
further restricted. In the summer of 1490 a measure was
carried which concentrated the actual direction of affairs in
the hands of a small body. The Council of Seventy was to
remain as a council of State; but the elections to the Signoria
were transferred, as under the old system, to <i>accoppiatori</i>,
named by a committee of seventeen, of whom Lorenzo
was one. The members of this committee were chosen arbitrarily,
and only one of them belonged to the minor guilds.
On them was dependent every branch of the administration,
more especially finances and the national debt.</p>

<p>The new committee’s first measure concerned the coinage.
In appearance it was sensible enough. The city and country
were overwhelmed with small and base foreign coin;
Sienese, Lucchese, Bolognese, &amp;c. August 28, 1490, a
decree was issued forbidding the circulation of foreign coins
on and after September 8. As Alamanno Rinuccini remarked,
it was not the first decree of the kind, and it was
no more observed this time than heretofore. Indeed, it was
practically impossible to distinguish the foreign <i>quattrini</i>
from the Florentine, outwardly very like them. So on May 1,
1491, a radical reform was undertaken. The old native
small coin, the so-called black quattrino, was called in, and
replaced by a new coin containing two ounces of silver to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the pound of copper, and reckoned as equivalent to five
danari, while the old one was called in at the rate of four
danari. The public treasuries were in future to receive only
the new white quattrini. The people were pleased, hoping
to get rid of the confusion. Their rejoicing did not last long.
Instead of melting down the old money, it was stealthily
brought into circulation again, and the old quattrino remained
in use side by side with the new one. Out of this
confusion arose endless difficulties; and the people found
that in taxes, duties, purchases of salt, everything where
produce went into the treasury, they were the chief sufferers.
The consequence was general discontent, directed principally
against the heads of the government, as their limited
number made them the more conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The evil was great, but it had not yet reached its worst
height. The increasingly demoralised condition of the administration
of finance displayed itself in another way,
which must have utterly ruined the credit of the State at
the first serious political crisis. This was connected with the
Medici finances. Lorenzo’s pecuniary difficulties had been
in no wise removed by the precautionary measures of 1480.
His manner of life, establishments, purchases, the provisions
for his children, his by no means disinterested liberality, the
bribes in money paid for his influence abroad, required large
sums. To try to meet these requirements with the produce
of his personal property (because he considered this more
secure and honourable),<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> would have been chimerical. He
had limited his banking-business and commercial speculations;
and to draw upon them never entered his head. During
his very last years he did a great deal of business in
Rome. Innocent VIII. was financially still more dependent
on him than on his own Genoese fellow-countrymen, and he
allowed him corresponding advantages. In 1489 he sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
him 30,000 hundredweight of alum at a very low price, in
compensation for losses sustained in the days of his predecessor;
and the alum trade passed almost entirely into
Lorenzo’s private hands. The farm-rent paid by him for
the works of Tolfa amounted to 100,000 florins. In May of
the same year Lorenzo furnished the Pope with a loan to
the same amount for one year; one-third of the sum in cash,
the other two-thirds in silk and woollen stuffs. For the
repayment, two-tenths, amounting to 60,000 florins, were
referred to the Florentine clergy, the rest to the revenues of
Città di Castello.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In 1490 Lorenzo redeemed from the Centurioni
of Genoa a valuable tiara which had been pledged to
them.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Cosimo Sassetti, one of the partners in the Medici
bank at Lyons, was also a papal collector in 1490. In the
case of smaller loans, princes sent valuables as pledges; the
Marquis of Mantua gave a precious stone for the sum of
4,000 gold florins, and when at a marriage-feast he wanted
to have it back, his brother-in-law, Ercole d’Este, offered
the salt-office of Modena for security in its place. These
transactions went on under Lorenzo’s eldest son and even
later.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> But the profits were uncertain, for all the parties
concerned were not skilful and prudent. Even supposing
that Lorenzo drew an income of 15,000 to 20,000 gold
florins from the old family estate, and about 10,000 from the
newly-acquired and gradually increasing one in the Pisan
territory, still it was terribly insufficient for his outlay. He
was driven to all kinds of shifts, at times even somewhat
mean ones, such as must have been sometimes very unpleasant
to him; as, for instance, in 1484, when he had to take
a loan of 4,000 ducats from Lodovico Sforza, or sell for the
same price the house given by Duke Francesco to his grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
During the difficulties of 1478 he had been compelled
to borrow from his cousins, the other Medici, 60,000
gold florins, for the repayment of which he gave security on
his possessions in Mugello. There were Florentine business
houses which paid him a yearly sum for lending them his
name.</p>

<p>This mixing up of his private money-matters with those
of the State brought about most unhappy consequences.
In the war of 1478, the pay of the troops was furnished
by the bank of the Bartolini, in which Lorenzo had a
share. They deducted eight per cent., in return for which
the commanders did not furnish the troops agreed upon, and
the community had to make up the deficit. The wretched
mismanagement of the military arrangements was all of a
piece with this. Yet Lorenzo still thought himself entitled
to venture on further operations of the same kind. The
chief financial posts were held by his minions. From the
treasurers (<i>camarlinghi</i>) of the offices of the national debt, of
the customs, of salt, of judicial contracts, &amp;c., he raised the
needful sums, which they handed over to him without difficulty,
first because they could refuse him nothing, and next
because they thought their own responsibility covered and
their personal security safe; for every newly appointed official
had to recover the sum lent out by his predecessor;
and as this process went on unchecked for years, it may
easily be imagined what a deficit there was at last, after all
the sham repayments one towards the other. The office of
the national debt suffered most. The supreme provveditore,
Antonio di Bernardo Miniati, had risen from the condition
of an artisan by the favour of Lorenzo, who had actually
made him a member of the Committee of Seventeen; and he
proceeded quite arbitrarily, to oblige his patron and at once
facilitate and hush up disgraceful embezzlement. During
the revolution of 1494 the great book of the Monte was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
missing; nevertheless, there was an exposure of how many
sums had gone to the numerous protégés and hangers-on of
the Medici in and out of Florence. There was also another
means by which to enrich them; and that was the furnishing
of supplies, among which the supplying of cloth to the
troops, in particular, brought great gain.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> But all possible
manœuvres and skill could not prevent the bad condition of
this unprincipled finance from becoming known. How
should they when, to mention only one instance, the Cardinalate
of Giovanni de’ Medici cost the State an expenditure
of 50,000 gold florins, independently of the sums which
found their way secretly into Rome, and were reckoned at
200,000 more?<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The State-creditors suffered most, from the
reduction in the rate of interest caused by the drafts deposited
in the Monte, and from the arrears of interest.
These bills, together with the extraordinary additional taxes
constantly repeated under various names, reduced the
national debt. What offended the citizens most and
damaged Lorenzo’s reputation with posterity more than
anything else was the plundering of the before-mentioned
<i>Monte delle doti</i>, the establishment intended for the dowries
of maidens, and in which all citizens, great and small, were
wont to make investments.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> It was a sort of bank of deposit,
somewhat on the plan of modern insurance-offices, and
its usefulness was increased by the changes of fortune only
too sudden in Florence. This establishment took its rise in
1424, when it was decreed that for the liquidation of the
shares in the national debt dating from 1325 to 1336, and
originally bringing in eighteen per cent. interest, the
creditors should be at liberty to convert a quota of what was
due to them into a dowry for their sons and daughters; from
1468 it was limited to daughters. The conditions were very
liberal. Whosoever paid or gave security for the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
104 gold florins, and had it put down to one of his children,
received at the end of fifteen years the sum of a thousand
florins in cash, or could, if he pleased, let it remain at five
per cent. interest. If the child in whose name the money
stood died, half the sum to which he would have had a
claim, according to the time that had elapsed, was paid back
to the father, and the other half went to the bank. The so-called
reform of the <i>Monte delle doti</i>, which, like all such
establishments, certainly needed improvement in its administration,
was one of the avowed objects of the change made in
the constitution in 1480; but it opened a door to the
misappropriation of its funds. In 1485 a decree was issued
whereby only a fifth of the dowry, i.e. two hundred florins in
the case above described, was to be paid in cash; the rest
was to be entered in a register called <i>libro non ito</i>, the unpaid
book, and to bear an interest of seven per cent. This
was not all. Six years later, the rate of interest was lowered
to three per cent.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> This came very near to bankruptcy, and
this bankruptcy touched the citizens to the quick, while it
brought the State into discredit. Hitherto the dower paid
through the Monte had in most cases been sufficient; now
the necessary additions to it became serious, and quite unattainable
for many families. So the number of marriages
diminished; that the consent of the head of the State had
to be secured before they could take place would sound incredible,
did it not belong to the system of such party-government.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
‘For many years,’ says Rinuccini,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> ‘Lorenzo
de’ Medici was doing his best, by a series of laws and decrees,
to ruin the great bank of the commonwealth, for the
purpose of getting rid of its obligations for the payment of
annuities and dowries, and obtaining arbitrary control over
the State finances. For this work he selected in particular
two helpers, Antonio di Bernardo and Ser Giovanni of Pratovecchio
(chancellor of the Riformagioni), worthless fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
who pointed out to him day by day the way to attain his
object.’</p>

<p>Though the position of the Medici was secured for a
time, their finances could not be set right. The banks of
Lyons and Bruges, directed by Leonetti de’ Rossi, Francesco
and Cosimo Sassetti, Tommaso Portinari, and others, only
saved themselves by compounding with their creditors.
Lorenzo’s correspondence shows what a vast deal of trouble
these pecuniary embarrassments gave him, notwithstanding
his levity in money-matters. As early as 1484 he had to
write to de’ Rossi to insist on withdrawing the name of
Medici from the Lyons firm before next Easter. Eighteen
months after, he ordered the balance of the Bruges bank to
be sent to him, in consequence of Portinari’s bad management.
On one day, April 21, 1488, he despatched to the
King of France, the Cardinal de Bourbon, the Duke and
Duchess of Bourbon, the Seigneur du Bouchage, the Bishop
of Valence, and others, no less than seventeen letters relating
to the Lyons bank and Francesco Sassetti, after whose death
in 1490 Lorenzo Spinelli took the direction of the Medici’s
financial interests in France.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It was inevitable that there
should be a vehement outcry against this disorder. Many
foreigners who had placed their money in the banks sustained
heavy losses, and on the violent overthrow of the Medici,
when their palace was plundered at the entry of Charles
VIII., the king’s quarter-master, the seigneur de Balassat,
who had given the signal for the plundering, defended himself
on the plea that the Medici bank of Lyons owed him
large sums.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> One of the sufferers by these shameful money-dealings
was a man who had done much for Lorenzo, and
who, on his side, was influenced in his relations with him
and his business agents by a consideration of the advantages
which Lorenzo’s political position might give him. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
was Philippe de Commines, who, at one of the most critical
moments of his life, was greatly injured by the pecuniary
difficulties of the Medici and their unwillingness or inability
to meet their obligations. After the death of Louis XI.,
Commines, who had been an instrument of the king’s
tyranny and enriched by his confiscations, was first sent
away from court for taking part in the intrigues of the
Princes against the Regent, Anne de Beaujeu; then shut up
in one of the iron cages at Loches; and, in the spring of
1488, sentenced by the Parliament to lose a fourth part of
his property, and find security for ten thousand crowns.
He found it impossible to realise his demands on the Medici
bank and liquidate the sums which he had deposited there
since 1478 through Louis’ confidant Du Bouchage, and part
of which had been employed in 1486 to support the opposition
against the Regent.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Even when Commines, set free
from his worst embarrassments, was again on the way to
political influence, these difficulties remained, and a letter
from Lorenzo to him<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> gives a glimpse into the financial
troubles of the Medici.</p>

<p>‘Illustrious Sir,’ so runs the letter, ‘I have received your
lordship’s letter, and my mind is penetrated with grief at
learning into what a state of irritation Cosimo Sassetti’s
last statement of accounts has put you. My regret would
be still greater could I imagine that you doubt the sentiments
of my house towards you, whereas I am for many
reasons so deeply indebted to you that I should deserve to
be called the most ungrateful of men if I paid you now in
any coin but such as I owe you for the numerous benefits
received from you in good and evil days. When in my inmost
mind I examine my obligations, I can assure your lordship
that neither by me nor by any of mine shall anything
be done which might indispose you towards me or give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
an unfavourable opinion of me. If Cosimo Sassetti’s expressions
with regard to your lordship’s interests should produce
such an unhappy effect, I should be most deeply grieved, as
it would be contrary to the true position of affairs and my
earnest intentions. I do indeed confess, and your lordship
knows it, that for some time past our Lyons house has
suffered such heavy losses that it was impossible to conceal
them from my present or former business friends, of whom
your lordship is one, and not to complain of them as Cosimo
has done. This may have made a bad impression on you;
but you may rest assured that there is really no occasion for
difference between us, for you can always dispose, not only
of the sum in dispute between you and Cosimo, but of my
whole means as if they were your own. I therefore beg your
lordship to put faith in me, that this matter may be ended
and leave no cloud between us. For your lordship’s friendship,
whether in prosperity or adversity, is of more value to
me than any sum of money.’</p>

<p>In spite of all these assurances, Commines’ demands were
discharged in what he considered a very inadequate manner
(<i>apointement bien mègre</i>).<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Nothing but the high value
which he set on the friendship of the Medici induced him
to keep quiet. ‘I believe,’ wrote Lorenzo Spinelli to
Lorenzo at the close of 1491,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> ‘the Sieur d’Argenton will
remain our friend. In order not to make him angry, I have
always told him that if God gives us grace to do well in
business and make up some of the losses we sustained in
Leonetto’s time, you will give him his share. I am of
opinion that this hope will induce him to further your interests,
if he puts faith in my words.’ Spinelli was right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Commines’ humour was likewise influenced by the favourable
turn which his affairs took after the agreement between
the young king Charles VIII. and the Princes, in the beginning
of September 1491. His last letter to Lorenzo,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
dated January 13, 1492, and signed ‘more than entirely
yours’ (<i>plus que tout vostre</i>), treats not of money-matters,
but of Charles’ marriage with the heiress of Britanny, of the
differences with Maximilian and England, and of the Duke
of Lorraine’s attempt on Metz, which it had been hoped
might be gained by treachery and surprise; a prelude to the
treachery and surprise in which a French king succeeded
but too well little more than a century later.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">LIFE IN FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1472 certain Venetians addressed to Lorenzo de’ Medici
and Niccolò Ardinghelli a pamphlet wherein they extolled
the advantages of their city and its inhabitants, and abused
Florence, her constitution, her policy, her commerce and
society, and the house of Medici. The challenge was accepted
by Benedetto Dei, a scion of an ancient family, a man
of much experience in affairs of state and of commerce, and
who had been for many years Florentine ambassador in
Constantinople, from whence he went to Damascus on a
commission for the Sultan. He defended his native city in
a lengthy and rather warm reply; a curious testimony to
the deep-seated differences between two states which were
often bitter enemies and scarcely ever real friends.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
‘Florence,’ says the irritated patriot, who seems not to have
been acquainted with the brilliant picture of the industry
and commerce of Venice drawn in the Great Council in 1420
by the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> ‘is more beautiful and
540 years older than your Venice. We spring from triply
noble blood. We are one-third Roman, one-third Frankish,
and one-third Fiesolan. Compare with this, I pray you, the
elements of which you are composed! First of all you are
Slavonians, secondly Paduans of Antenor’s dirty traitor-brood,
thirdly fisher-people from Malamocco and Chioggia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
We hold by the Gospel of S. John, you by that of S. Mark,
in which there is as much difference as between fine French
wool and that with which mattresses are stuffed. We have
round about us thirty thousand estates, owned by noblemen and
merchants, citizens and craftsmen, yielding us yearly bread
and meat, wine and oil, vegetables and cheese, hay and
wood, to the value of 900,000 ducats in cash, as you Venetians
and Genoese, Chians and Rhodians, who come to buy
them, know well enough. We have two trades greater than
four of yours in Venice put together&mdash;wool and silk. Witness
the Roman court and that of the king of Naples, the
Marches and Sicily, Constantinople and Pera, Broussa and
Adrianople, Salonika and Gallipoli, Chios and Rhodes,
where to your envy and disgust there are Florentine consuls
and merchants, churches and houses, banks and offices, and
whither go more Florentine wares of all kinds, especially
silken stuffs and gold and silver brocades, than from Venice,
Genoa and Lucca put together. Ask your own merchants
who visit Marseilles, Avignon, Lyons, and the whole of Provence,
Bruges, Antwerp, London, and other cities, where
there are great banks and royal warehouses, fine dwellings,
and stately churches; ask them who should know, as they
go to the fairs every year, whether they have seen the banks
of the Medici, the Pazzi, the Capponi, the Buondelmonti, the
Corsini, the Falconieri, the Portinari, and the Ghini, the
bank of the Medici and their partners at Milan, and a hundred
others which I will not name, because to do so I should
need at least a ream of paper. You say we are bankrupt
since Cosimo’s death. If we have had losses, it is owing to
your dishonesty and the wickedness of your Levant merchants,
who have made us lose hundreds of thousands&mdash;people
with well-known names who have filled Constantinople
and Pera with failures, whereof our great houses
could tell many a tale. But though Cosimo is dead and
buried, he did not take his gold florins and the rest of his
money and bonds with him into the other world; nor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
banks and store-houses, nor his woollen and silken cloths,
nor his plate and jewellery; but he left them all to his
worthy sons and grandsons, who take pains to keep them
and to add to them, to the vexation of the Venetians and
other envious foes, whose tongues are more malicious and
slanderous than if they were Sienese.’ Such was the Florentine’s
retort to the attacks of the Venetians, whom he bitterly
attacked in his turn, when in 1479 they concluded the
disadvantageous treaty by which they ceded Negroponte and
other of their Levantine possessions to the Turks.</p>

<p>‘Our beautiful Florence,’ says the same chronicler, ‘contains
within the city in this present year 1472, 270 shops
belonging to the wool-merchants’ guild, from whence their
wares are sent to Rome and the Marches, Naples and Sicily,
Constantinople and Pera, Adrianople, Broussa and the whole
of Turkey. It contains also eighty-three rich and splendid
warehouses of the silk-merchants’ guild, and furnishes gold
and silver stuffs, velvet, brocade, damask, taffeta, and satin,
to Rome and Naples, Catalonia and the whole of Spain, especially
Seville, and to Turkey and Barbary. The principal
fairs to which these wares go are those of Genoa, the
Marches, Ferrara, Mantua, and the whole of Italy; Lyons,
Avignon, Montpelier, Antwerp, and London.’ The number
of the great banks amounted to thirty-three, that of the
cloth-warehouses, which also retailed woollen cloths of all
kinds (<i>tagliare</i>), to thirty-two; the shops of the cabinet-makers,
whose business was carving and inlaid work (<i>tarsia</i>),
to eighty-four, and the workshops of the stone-cutters and
marble-workers in the city and its immediate neighbourhood
to fifty-four. There were forty-four goldsmiths’ and
jewellers’ shops, thirty gold-beaters, silver-wire drawers, and
wax-figure makers; the last being in those days a productive
branch of industry, as it was the custom to consecrate
in the churches and chapels wax-figures of all kinds (<i>voti</i>),
chiefly images. ‘Go through all the cities of the world,’
adds the chronicler, ‘nowhere will you find, nor will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
ever be able to find, artists in wax equal to those we have
now in Florence, and to whom the figures in the Nunziata
(the Servite Church) can bear witness.’ Another flourishing
branch of industry was the making of the light and elegant
gold and silver wreaths and garlands which were worn by
young maidens of high degree, and gave their name to the
artist-family of Ghirlandajo. Sixty-six was the number of
the apothecaries’ and grocers’ shops; seventy that of the
butchers, besides eight large shops in which were sold fowls
of all kinds, as well as game, and also the native wines
which were considered best with game, particularly the pungent
white wine, called Trebbiano, from San Giovanni in the
upper Arno valley; it would wake the dead, adds Dei, in its
praise. The Florentine had a right to be proud of his
‘beautiful’ city. From 1422, when Gino Capponi, the conqueror
of Pisa, introduced the art of gold-spinning (the gold
thread hitherto used having been procured from Cöln and
from Cyprus),<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> down to the time of Lorenzo, was the most
brilliant period of the silk manufacture which brought great
wealth to the city. The Emperor Sigismund’s ill-famed consort,
Barbara von Cilly, once sent one of her people with
1,200 gold florins and three bars of gold to buy silken stuffs.
In 1422 the first armed galley was equipped for the voyage
to Alexandria, and when she was launched there was a
solemn procession to implore the protection of Heaven. Thus
Florence began to do without the help of Venetian and
Genoese vessels; and the two latter states never got over
their vexation at this. The Florentines, however, never
became famous sailors. Meanwhile the home-produce kept
pace with this freer connection with transmarine lands.
There seem to have been no silk-worms reared in Florence
before 1423; this branch of industry was much older in
other parts of Tuscany: in Modigliana, Pistoja, Pescia,
Lucca, &amp;c. In Lorenzo’s days the artisans began to emigrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and transplanted their art to foreign lands. The restrictions
of emigration by statute proved at first useless and
afterwards injurious. The extent of the intercourse between
Florence and other lands is shown by the list of commercial
firms established in various countries in 1469; in France
there were twenty-four; in the kingdom of Naples thirty-seven;
in Turkey no less than fifty, which were under the
protection of the consul Mainardo Ubaldini, whose general
relations with the Turkish government became so much the
better, as those of the Venetians, whose political and commercial
interests too often clashed, grew less secure. Long
afterwards it was known that the Florentines held in their
hands the whole commerce of France; and in 1521, when
war broke out between Charles V. and Francis I., and the
Florentine merchant-colony at Lyons found itself in danger,
a memorial requesting letters of safe-conduct was addressed
to the treasurer Robertet, by no less than thirty houses, including
the Albizzi, Guadagni, Panciatichi, Salviati, Bartolini,
Strozzi, Gondi, Manetti, Antinori, Dei, Ridolfi, Pitti,
Tedaldi, and other familiar names.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Many of these families
married and settled in France.</p>

<p>In a city where prosperity was so general, it strikes one
as remarkable that the rate of interest on money remained
so high. When it is remembered that about 1420 the
usurers were forbidden to take more than 20 per cent., and
that about ten years later the hitherto excluded Jews were
admitted in the hope of thereby finding a protection against
the greediness of the Christians, it may be easily perceived
how shocking the evil was. The complaints about compulsory
loans are quite intelligible with such a high rate of
interest. That the intended remedy proved fruitless, and
Jews and Christians sucked the blood of their neighbours all
alike, may be imagined. More than once there was some
idea of a public loan establishment. This was the case in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
1488, when the popular orator Bernardino da Feltre, of the
Minorite order, was preaching in Sta. Croce. He tried to
obtain Lorenzo’s support for the erection of a Monte di
Pietà, but his efforts proved unsuccessful. It was an universally
known fact that the execution of the project was
prevented because the Signoria was bribed by a rich Jewish
money-changer in Pisa, where this trade had found a special

exclusion of the Jews took place, whose gains in Florence
alone were reckoned at 50,000,000 gold florins, and the
erection by voluntary contributions of the public loan establishment,
which, together with that founded by St. Antonine,
and other similar ones, was in the course of years exposed
to many vicissitudes.</p>

<p>It was natural that the wealth of the merchants should
greatly influence their manner of life. The new aristocracy,
which had risen in a great measure by trade and commerce,
continued, after the pattern of the family at the head of the
State, to combine politics with other business, and liked to
display a splendour corresponding to their means, not only
in buildings, pious foundations, and works of art, but also in
the festive occasions of domestic life. Their houses were
richly furnished. The numerous cabinet-makers and marble-workers,
chiefly engaged on decorative works, were not
solely occupied with churches and public buildings; both they,
and painters and sculptors of a higher order, vied with each
other in the decoration of dwelling-houses. Pictures were interspersed
and relieved with marble and terra-cotta busts. At
festive banquets fine table-linen, in keeping with the elegance
of the plate, was always used. Up to this time there was
little exaggerated luxury; the majority were too cautious for
that; and if they wanted to honour a distinguished guest or
celebrate a wedding, friends lent each other their plate,
following the example of the Medici with the Alamanni,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Della Stufa, Lanfredini, Nasi, Sassetti, Davanzati, and
others.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The same thing occurred at a banquet given by
Messer Antonio Ridolfi, ex-ambassador at Naples, to the
Duke of Calabria, who had stood godfather to his child.
On great occasions similar loans, to which all the wealthy
citizens contributed, were made to the Signoria. For ordinary
occasions people often used, besides silver spoons and
forks, gifts of the community or of friends, chiefly brazen
table-plate, dishes, cans, salvers, with silver centres and
enamelled or niello edges, with the owner’s arms and frequently
also those of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Fine crystal was considered
necessary for a well-furnished table. Venice provided most
of this article, but Tuscany furnished many glass-factories.</p>

<p>The festivals, which increased in frequency in the days
of Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici and the oft-repeated
visits of princes, necessarily contributed to the increase of
splendour and gaiety. More than once the cost exceeded
the amount of supply. If Luca Pitti far outran his means
it was, at least, the indulgence of a noble passion&mdash;that of
building&mdash;which tempted him to such extravagance, and
a miscalculation in politics which overthrew him. But
others were ruined by senseless luxury. A striking example
of this is Benedetto Salutati, who, it will be remembered,
took part in Lorenzo’s tournament. He was a grandson of
the celebrated chancellor; his father had acquired a considerable
fortune in business, in which the son succeeded
him. Benedetto, we read,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> had made himself a fine position
and was highly esteemed; but he was far from being able
to enter the lists with many others as far as the age and
nobility of his family were concerned, nor did his fortune
put him in a position to maintain a lasting rivalry with
them. Nevertheless, he did vie with them. When he rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to that tournament at five-and-twenty, the housings and
trappings of his horse were adorned with 168 pounds of fine
silver at sixteen ducats a pound, and the cost of the work
was reckoned at 8,000<i>l.</i> That he united love for art with
love for spending is proved by the fact that his silver helmet
was wrought by Antonio del Pollaiuolo.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> But the immoderate
luxury into which he launched may be learned
from the description of the banquet which he and his fellow-merchants
gave, February 16, 1476, to the sons of King
Ferrante at Naples, where the Salutati, like so many of their
fellow-countrymen, had settled, and had intercourse with
the royal house through their connection with the above-mentioned
Antonio Ridolfi, whose daughter was Benedetto’s
wife. It was as if a Florentine merchant had tried to vie
with the splendour shown by Cardinal Pietro Riario when
Ercole d’Este’s bride was in Rome. The very arrangement
of the house gave a foretaste of what was to come. The
staircase was hung with tapestry and wreaths of yew; the
great hall was decorated with richly-worked carpets; and
from the ceiling, covered with cloth of the Aragonese colours
ornamented with the Duke of Calabria’s arms, hung two
great chandeliers of carved and gilt wood bearing wax
candles. Opposite the principal entrance, on a dais covered
with carpets, stood the dining-table, spread with the finest
lace over a worked cover. One side of the hall was occupied
by a large sideboard, on which stood about eighty ornamental
pieces of plate&mdash;salvers, basins, fruit-baskets,
tankards&mdash;mostly silver, some gold, besides the silver table-service,
consisting of about three hundred plates of various
kinds, bowls, beakers, and dishes. Adjoining the hall were
two rooms opening into each other, hung with woollen stuff
representing foliage, and handsomely carpeted. Here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
company assembled before and after dinner, and divers
musicians contributed to the liveliness of the meal. The
guests took their seats amid a flourish of trumpets and fifes.
At one end of the table sat the Count of Altavilla, next to
him Don Pietro of Aragon, the Duke of Calabria’s younger
son, a boy of four years old; then came the four sons of the
king&mdash;Don Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, Don Federigo, Count
of Altamura, Don Giovanni, and Don Arrigo.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Next to the
latter sat the Count of Belcastro, then came the Count of
Ventimiglia and Messer Carlo da Toralto. The Florentine
consul, Tommaso Ginori, and Lorenzo Strozzi sat one on
each side of Marino Caracciolo; next to them came Francesco
Nori (one of the victims of the Pazzi conspiracy) and
Andrea Spanocchi of Siena. The seats at the other end of
the table were occupied by the Commander de Requesens,
Ferrante di Gennaro, and Messer Federigo Carvajal, Commander
of Rimini. The outer side of the long table was left
for the sewers and cup-bearers, who served the guests and
tasted the dishes before presenting them to the princes.
Besides these, courtiers stood around the table, partly in
attendance partly joining in the conversation. The order of
the dinner was as follows: First the introductory course; to
each guest was presented a little dish of gilt cakes made of
pine-apple kernels, and a little majolica cup containing a
beverage made of milk and called Natta (<i>guincata</i>). This
was followed by eight silver dishes decorated with coats of
arms and mottoes, and containing jelly made from the
breast of capons; the dish intended for the duke had, in the
middle, a fountain which threw up a shower of orange-flower
water. The first part of the meal consisted of twelve courses
of different kinds of meat, game, veal, ham, pheasants, partridges,
capons, chickens, and blanc-mange; at the end
there was placed before the duke a large silver dish, from
which, when the cover was taken off, a number of birds flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
out. On two large salvers were brought two peacocks,
apparently alive, with their tails spread, burning perfumes
issuing from their bills, and on their breasts, attached to a
silken ribbon, the duke’s arms and the motto <i>Modus et ordo</i>.
The second part of the entertainment consisted of nine
courses of sweets of various kinds, tarts, light and delicate
pastry, with hippocras. The wines, mostly native&mdash;Italian
or Sicilian&mdash;were numerous, and between every two guests
was placed a list of the fifteen different kinds, of which the
lighter found most favour. At the end of the banquet
scented water was offered to everyone in which to dip his
hands; then the table-cloth was removed, and on the table
was placed a great dish containing a mountain of green
boughs with precious essences whose perfume spread through
the hall.</p>

<p>In the middle of the banquet some mumming<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> was
announced. Eight youths entered dressed as huntsmen,
with horns, hounds, and slain game; they were musicians
of the chapel royal, and took leave after entertaining the
company with some pleasing music. After dinner the guests
went to the next room, where they entered into lively discourse
and listened to music and singing. The duke and
the Count of Belcastro conversed with the Florentine merchants
and spoke of scarcely anything but Florence and the
prince’s stay in Tuscany. After about an hour the sewers
brought the dessert; for each person a silver dish of various
kinds of sweets, with covers made of wax and sugar; those
for the princes and knights adorned with coloured coats of
arms and mottoes, those for the merchants with escutcheons
and trade-marks. Cup-bearers also brought wine in gold
and silver goblets. Towards the fifth hour of the night the
guests departed, having stayed about four hours. The whole
house was full of the courtiers and servants of the princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and nobles. All praised the excellency of the dishes; never,
it was said, had a more splendid banquet been known.
Salutati’s love of show, however, brought its own punishment;
unless indeed he was ruined by the heavy troubles
brought upon his home by these same Neapolitan princes
and nobles not long after. Four or five years after this
banquet, according to his own declaration to the registrars,
he had returned to his native city a penniless man, intending
to give up his business altogether, as, under the sad circumstances
of the time and the heavy burdens of the community,
he was working at a clear loss. About this time he changed
his residence to Rome, where he was engaged in banking
business in 1491.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Such doings as these, however, were exceptional; generally,
the mode of life in Florence, as throughout Italy, was
simple. In describing the English plenipotentiary who
spent some time with Pope Eugene, Vespasiano da Bisticci
remarks that he had given up his native custom of sitting
four hours at table and adopted the Italian fashion of having
but one dish, from which the whole household dined together.
Even in the noblest houses there was no extravagance;
they had only the produce of the immediate neighbourhood
and, in particular, of their own estates. Thus it was
that an increase of rural industry was doubly desirable. In
later days it was wont to be related of Filippo Strozzi the
Elder that he introduced the cultivation of the artichoke
and that of a new species of fig, and both Cosimo and
Lorenzo de’ Medici carefully followed the progress of agriculture.
At parties there was no lack of intellectual enjoyments,
such as music and improvisation. Politian gives, in
a letter to Pico della Mirandola, an account of a dinner at
the house of Paolo Orsini, who was in the service of the
Republic; on this occasion Orsini’s son, a boy of eleven,
stood up and sang some verses of his own composition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Banquets given for entertainment, as well as for learned
discourse, chiefly took place at the villas. The richer and
more distinguished Florentines divided their time between
the city and the country. It has been seen how the pleasant,
healthy, fertile neighbourhood of Florence, especially the
hills easily attainable for both pedestrians and horsemen,
became covered with villas. These gradually spread further
out in all directions, up and down the valley of the Arno,
beyond Fiesole and Ponte a Sieve to Mugello, better suited
for a real summer residence; along the line of hills towards
Prato and the valley of the Bisenzio; on the left bank of
the Arno through the valleys of the Ema, the Pesa, and the
Elsa, and the rich grape-country of Chianti, to the Sienese
border. In proportion to the number and beauty of the city
residences the number and richness of the country-houses
increased also. Hither came princes, kings, and popes;
here they enjoyed hospitality at once grand, cordial, and
cheerful. The country-life contributed not a little to arouse
and maintain liveliness, freshness, fertility, and elasticity of
mind in those who were overwhelmed with grave business of
all kinds. The villas, far more than the town-houses, were
the places where men met for social intercourse, partly
because there they could keep themselves more free from
business, partly because they were there not troubled with
the want of space which was an inconvenience in the city.
The villa-life of the <i>literati</i> has been already mentioned.
The remarks concerning country-residences and country-life
made by Leon Battista Alberti, about the time now
under consideration, in his book ‘The Father of the Family,’<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
throw light on an important side of the condition of the
citizens, and give a glimpse into the temperament and tastes
of the classes who held the direction of the commonwealth.
These men did not give themselves up to idle pastimes, but
to gaining and keeping a clear survey of personal and civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
relations, and to increasing their own prosperity, and with
it that of others, by a wise culture which looked beyond the
limits of ordinary domestic economy.</p>

<p>There was a darker side to this country-life, and among
its shadows was that of the gaming-table. As far back as
1285 a decree had been found necessary forbidding the use
of dice and other games of chance,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> and in the year before
the Pazzi conspiracy another similar decree was issued.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
These prohibitions, however, shared the fate of the sumptuary
laws, and no doubt the relations with Naples in the
fourteenth century did no good in this respect. Still the
Florentines never went such lengths as disgraced the society
of cardinals and great lords at Rome in the latter half of
the fifteenth century in the days of Sixtus IV. and Innocent
VIII. Alberti, who in another of his writings<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> describes
gaming and its attendant ruin arising from either loss or
gain and the bad company inseparable from it, probably
witnessed these corruptions more in Rome than in his
native land. But while in the city, where they were more
exposed to view, men proceeded more cautiously and chess
was the game chiefly played, the villas were too often scenes
of gambling. That this habit was by no means rooted out
in the city is shown by the history of St. Antonine. After
the holy archbishop had been preaching one day in the
church of Sto. Stefano he passed, with the cross carried
before him, through the Borgo Sant’Apostolo. As he was
passing the Loggia of the Buondelmonti and saw a company
at play, he entered and overthrew the tables; the gamblers,
ashamed, threw themselves at his feet and begged for
pardon.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>The games which were also bodily exercises, and lived on
in another form, as the <i>giuoco del pallone</i>, have already been
mentioned. They were not without danger; in 1487 a son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of Ugolino Verino lost his life by a blow from a ball while
engaged in the game of <i>Maglio</i>. During the uncommonly
sharp winter of 1491 these games took place on the frozen
surface of the Arno. Hunting of all kinds had always been
a favourite pastime; in many country-houses may be seen
places prepared for decoying birds. Hawking stood first of
all in the lists of amusements. For graver exercises of the
chase there was a better field in the woods of Mugello, the
low country round Pisa, the Volterra country, and the
bordering Maremma, than in the well-built and thickly-inhabited
environs of the city. As for the stage, profane
drama, as is shown by the remarks of Poliziano, was just in
the dawn of its existence, and in its present antiquated form
only suited for the higher circles. This last was also the
condition of the Latin dramas, of which a great number had
been composed since the beginning of the fourteenth century.
Classical comedies were performed by students. May 12,
1488, the ‘Menæchmi’ of Plautus, a favourite and oft-copied
piece, was acted under the direction of Messer Paolo
Comparini, probably one of the professors at the university.
Poliziano wrote the Latin prologue for this performance, at
which Lorenzo was present.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The sacred plays continued to
attract high and low; and, besides the customary representations
on feast-days, they never failed to be performed for
the edification of foreign princes and potentates who came
to the city. The Florentines seem to have been especially
skilled in these dramatic representations, for their companies
acted in other places outside their own city, for example, at
Rome. Famous artists, like Brunelleschi and the engineer
Cecca, who met his death in the Faenza campaign of 1488,
invented the apparatus for these mystery-plays and also for
the processions in the open air, on which occasions mass
was said on the <i>ringhiera</i> of the palace of the Signoria before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the people who thronged the square. The most solemn procession
of all was that on the eve of St. John; the scene
was the precincts of the cathedral and the baptistery, where
a gigantic machinery of clouds, with saints and angels, was
built up under a lofty canopy of linen.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The feasts of the
Church were many and splendid; most chiefly that of
St. John, which was connected with the history of the city
and the State. On the eve of this day and on the day itself
the shops of the merchants and artificers made a display of
their finest goods; Lorenzo lent his most valuable show-pieces
to his friends; and in the Baptistery was exhibited
the great silver reredos with its statuettes and reliefs. The
splendour was heightened by the participation of the numerous
clerical and lay societies, and by the influence of the
festivals on the patriotism of the multitude through their
connection with glorious events, the memory of which was
kept alive among the people by these reciprocal relations.
These historical reminiscences went back to the very earliest
mythical times of the city. Mystery-plays, shows, and
similar festivals were not confined to the churches, companies,
and public occasions and places, but also took place
in the houses of distinguished citizens, and artists constantly
took part in them.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> When it is considered that at the
beginning of the next century the number of the civil companies
or brotherhoods for religious exercises amounted to
370,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> partly for children and partly for adults, it may easily
be understood how closely domestic life was intertwined with
that of the Church.</p>

<p>Some of these societies, called Standard-companies (Compagnie
di Stendardo) did not approve of social cheerfulness.
But the unions of the lower classes for the purpose of festivities,
shows, games, and merrymakings were those called
potenze. Their origin is commonly referred to the time of
the Duke of Athens; it was probably contemporary with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
development of the democratic element in the commonwealth.
These societies, whose festivals and performances
strongly resembled a carnaval, were also intended for spiritual
exercises. Their number differed greatly at different
times; their names are mostly fantastically derived from
the occupation or residence of the parties concerned; there
was an emperor of the Prato of Ognisanti, a king of the
wool-carders of Orsanmichele, and various others with similar
titles derived from localities in Camaldoli; monarchs of
Sant’Ambrogio and Terrarossa, dukes of the Via Guelfa, of
the Arno, of Camporeggi, of the moon, the dove, the owl;
princes of the apple and of the standard-carriage, grand
signors of the Pitti and of the dyers, lords of the chain, the
swallow, the kitchen-range, the sword, the scourge, the elm,
and suchlike names. They all bore coats of arms on their
banners; thus the emperor of the Prato displayed an eagle;
the grand signor of the dyers, a caldron standing on the
fire; the duke of the Arno, a pillar of the Rubaconte bridge,
with himself majestically seated thereon, surrounded by
players. These societies had for their chief object carnaval-amusements,
with games and pastimes which degenerated into
wild orgies, till in the sixteenth century the license became
so great, the waste of time and money and the annoyance to
the other citizens so disgraceful, that, after restrictions had
been tried in vain, the whole thing was put an end to.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
Lorenzo has been reproached with having encouraged shows
and entertainments in order to keep the people occupied and
well-disposed towards himself. He probably acted with
this view just as much as the Duke of Athens; and when
the Medici came back in 1512 from their long exile,
his son Giuliano and his grandson Lorenzo employed
these same means, companies and pastimes, chiefly, as a
historian of the Medicean party, Filippo de’ Nerli, confesses,
in order to keep the citizens and common people in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
humour with triumphs, festivals, and public shows, and to
gather the young nobles around themselves.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> But the
inclinations and habits of the people made the attainment of
Lorenzo’s object easy to him. The widespread feeling
for art, which gave a special charm to all public displays,
contributed not a little thereto.</p>

<p>Lorenzo revolutionised and developed the songs of the
carnaval. The romance writer Lasca relates<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> the state in
which he found the carnaval and what he made of it. Youths
and men were wont to walk about the streets in women’s clothes
and mimick the girls and women on May-day. The songs
they sang were all much the same; the variety introduced
into their form and substance by Lorenzo was enhanced by the
melodies of Heinrich Isaak. The first masquerade of this
kind was that of the glass-blowers and pastrycooks, with
a three-part choir. The Triumphs (<i>trionfi</i>) were great
mythological or allegorical performances; the Chariots
(<i>carri</i>), representations of works, &amp;c. Richly dressed horsemen,
to the number of 300, rode beside these chariots, which
came out in the afternoon and often enlivened the streets
till far into the night, accompanied by men on foot carrying
white wax torches. There was also instrumental music and
singing in four or eight parts, sometimes even fifteen parts.
According to the style and contents of the songs, so the
nature of these popular amusements was varied. In several
of Lorenzo’s carnaval-songs the license of the day is but too
evident; they were downright Roman saturnalia. Later on,
when reaction took place against this worldliness, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
thing attacked was the carnaval. It will be seen hereafter
that this opposition had begun long before men’s minds
were biassed in a new direction in consequence of a revolution
in the political circumstances of Italy and the foreboding of
evil to come. The sobering change which followed this
license is shown by a satirical dialogue in verse on the carnaval,
which was forbidden the houses and streets; a popular
production of historical value on this account, that it
expresses a foreboding of the many evils which were to
befall Rome&mdash;Rome, the home of the saturnalia, which
threatened to swallow up all life and effort as in a whirlpool:<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Questo è stato carnasciale<br />
C’ha ’l cervel nelle scarpette,<br />
Con suo certe gente grette<br />
C’ han giocato il capitale:<br />
Hanno avuto certe strette<br />
Tu Fiorenza le lor mercíe<br />
Stazonate brutte e lercíe<br />
Sì che han perso ogni lor fede.<br />
Poi che vai, cammina presto<br />

<p class="p1">Amid the coarse sensual doings of the time there were
yet some festivals in which, although accompanied by immoderate
display, poetic feeling found room for expression.
During one carnaval Lorenzo got up a brilliant procession
representing the triumph of Paulus Æmilius; it was on this
occasion that the young painter Francesco Granacci gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the first proofs of his remarkable talent for decoration. In
another procession of the same kind the planets were personified
and easily recognised by their emblems, and were
drawn through the streets in seven chariots amid the sound
of music and songs composed for the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Allegorical
representations of this sort were common. Twenty or thirty
years later Raphael gave them the highest consecration of
art in his pictures of the planets, and the multitude was not
lacking in a sense of allegory. These gay scenes were
rivalled by the carnaval procession got up by Bartolommeo
Benci in honour of Marietta Strozzi Giachinotti, a granddaughter
of Palla.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Eight young men of distinguished
families&mdash;Pucci, Altoviti, Vespucci, Girolami, and others&mdash;took
part in it. On the evening of the carnaval they all
went together to the house of the Benci, whose name is still
borne by a street in the Sta. Croce quarter. They were all
dressed in vests of silver and crimson brocade, and mounted
on horses with silken housings, each accompanied by eight
grooms and thirty torch-bearers. After supper the whole
party proceeded to the lady’s house, followed by four men
carrying a stage twenty ells high, made of branches of
laurel, yew, cypress, and other evergreens, and adorned with
a number of allegorical representations of the triumph of
love, with the escutcheons of the lady and the author of the
festival, surmounted by a bleeding and burning heart from
which rockets flew up. Round about were pipers and
mounted pages dressed in green. Bartolommeo Benci, with
gilt wings fastened to his shoulders, came riding on a handsome
and richly caparisoned horse, surrounded by fifteen
youths of good family dressed in crimson, and 150 torch-bearers
wearing his colours. Amerigo and Francesco Benci
and the lady’s brothers Nanni and Strozza Strozzi joined the
party. The gentlemen, with gilt spears in their hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
showed off their horses before the windows; then Bartolommeo
took the wings from off his shoulders and threw
them on the triumphal stage, which at once burst into
flames, while a number of rockets flew up from it, some high
in the air, some towards the house. When the fireworks
were over the party retired, the giver of the entertainment
making his horse step backwards till he was out of the
square. They then went round to the houses of the lady-loves
of all the gentlemen, and finished with an aubade
(<i>mattinata</i>) before the house of Marietta, who during the
whole scene remained at the window, between four wax
torches, ‘with such a stately grace as Lucretia herself would
not have needed to be ashamed of.’ The show ended at
dawn of day with a breakfast at Bartolommeo’s house. All
the Signoria’s servants, who had kept order during the
night, received stockings of the Benci colours.</p>

<p>The people always preserved their unwearied gaiety,
which Ariosto called ‘lo spirito bizarro fiorentino.’ They
were always wide awake, ready for a jest, keen in perception,
quick at a repartee, disposed to give merit its due, but
with the eyes of a lynx for every weakness. The merry
meetings with their stories, not inventions of the Decamerone
but the links that connected it with the prevailing manners,
easily degenerated into buffoonery, as many examples remain
to show. As the Florentines went round as jesters to the
courts of princes, so they had in the herald or knight of the
Signoria a sort of official buffoon who was, however, employed
in earnest as well as in jest. The best known jesters
belong to the fifteenth century; of these, the barber Burchiello
represents the literary type, while the chief example
of the ordinary jester with his verbal witticisms is the
Piovano Arlotto or Arlotto Mainardi, vicar of a little place in
the diocese of Fiesole, who is mentioned in Lorenzo’s
‘Beoni,’ a true mirror of the somewhat coarse-grained wit
of these revels. Besides the tales of Francesco Sacchetti,
written at its commencement, which are satirical in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
plot as well as in their too often licentious phraseology,
the two best known examples of buffoonery overstepping the
acknowledged limits of fiction, both in the form of romances,
belong to the fifteenth century. The one story is that of
the fat cabinet-maker, Manetto Ammanatini, a jest which is
said to have driven its victim, a master of artistic cabinet-making
and tarsia-work, away to Hungary. It originated
with Brunelleschi and his artist-friends, and the actual
authorship of the tale has been attributed to him. The
other story treats of Bianco Alfani, who was made to believe
that he had been chosen Podestà of Norcia, and had
to suffer for the delusion.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The species of humour which
distinguishes these compositions was long preserved in the
<i>villeggiature</i>. Lorenzo was no stranger to it, and Leo X.,
in the story of Baraballo, gave himself up to it in a manner
little becoming his dignity.</p>

<p>As regards moral weakness and defects this period was
certainly not better than its neighbours; and there can be
no hesitation in accusing it of having, by gradually accustoming
people to the powers that then were, paved the way
for the destruction of the commonwealth in favour of one
man, who was not a Lorenzo. The lamentations over the
corruption of the times were very frequent. ‘O city of
Florence!’ cried the honest Vespasiano da Bisticci in 1480,
‘thou art full of usury and dishonest gain! The one devours
the other; greed has made thy people foes one towards the
other. Evil-doing has become so habitual that no one is
ashamed of it. In these latter days thou hast witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
such unheard-of doings among thy citizens, such disorders
and failures, and dost not yet perceive that it is a judgment
from God, and thus thou continuest in thy hardness of heart.
There is no hope for thee, for thou thinkest of nought but
money-making; and yet thou seest how the wealth of thy
citizens passeth away like smoke as soon as they have closed
their eyes.’ Whatever might be the state of affairs, however,
such words as these are not to be taken literally.
There was an immense amount of good sterling material left
in the people who had outstripped others on the road to
intellectual knowledge, civil order, and industrial development.
The peculiar relation between the different classes,
which, in the ultimate development of democracy, in some
measure neutralised its evils, struck root so deeply that it
was never completely destroyed by the predominance of
Spanish manners which undermined and strove against
it for centuries. The Tuscan countryman, raised by the
old colony-system, which formed a sort of joint possession,
assumed an attitude of freedom towards his lord; the hard
and fast lines by which classes were divided in other lands
were never known here. The Florentine nobility never
forgot that by far the greater part of their number had risen
from the ranks of the people in times which were not remote
enough to be buried in the night of ages; and in their persons
the people felt themselves to a certain extent ennobled.
Feudalism never attained its full force here; even when its
tendencies prevailed throughout all the rest of Italy except
Venice, in Florence it had little more than a formal existence.
Down to the extinction of the Medici race, with a
few exceptions, they never cast off the traditions of the
citizen element. Thus in Florence there were never, as
elsewhere, violent conflicts aroused by the sharpness of social
contrasts. Conflicts of another kind were avoided by the
fact that, since the strengthening of the commonwealths,
the higher orders of clergy, notwithstanding their considerable
possessions, exercised no real territorial power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
almost always kept on good terms with the commonwealths.
In the appointment of bishops, too, the popular element on
the whole prevailed, though sometimes, and indeed repeatedly
during the fifteenth century, single appointments were
made from a purely papal point of view. The reaction
which set in so soon after Lorenzo’s death against the laxity
of morals which is laid to his charge, and the heroic perseverance
with which these Florentines defended their independence
for nearly forty years, prove most clearly what
wholesome qualities were hidden within the nature of this
genuine, pliant, powerful citizen-people.</p>

<p>The picture of the Florentines in the last days of the
Republic, sketched by an historian of the following century,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
is equally true of Lorenzo’s time: ‘I do not share the
opinion of those who refuse to admit that the Florentines
can be noble-minded and consider them low and plebeian
because they are merchants. I have often secretly wondered
how people who from their childhood have been accustomed
to handle bales of wool and silken threads, or to work like
slaves all day and part of the night at the loom or the dye-cauldron,
often, when needed, display such loftiness of heart
and greatness of soul that they speak and act surpassingly
well. The air, a medium between the keen atmosphere of
Arezzo and the heavy air of Pisa, doubtless has some influence
on this peculiarity. Whosoever considers deeply the
nature and manners of the Florentines must arrive at the
conclusion that they are more fitted to command than to
obey. I do not deny that there are among them haughty,
covetous, and violent men, such as are to be found elsewhere.
Nay, they are even worse here than in other places;
for as talent and merit are more brilliant there than elsewhere,
so also evil qualities are more conspicuous&mdash;so hard
is it for them to preserve moderation. Their manner of life
is simple and thrifty, but distinguished by cleanliness such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
as is not met with elsewhere. It may be said that in this
respect artisans and people who live by daily labour are a
pattern to the citizens of higher position; for whereas the
latter are easily led away to the taverns if they hear that
good wine is to be had there, and give themselves a day of
pleasure, the former stay at home with the thriftiness of
tradespeople who work seeking for their enjoyment in
advance, and with the modesty of citizens who understand
moderation, rules, and discipline, and will not quit the safe
path. Of course there are families which have a great
household and a rich table, such as would become noblemen.
People call each other by their Christian names, also by
their family names, and usually say ‘thou’ unless there is a
great difference of rank or age. The knights, doctors, prebendaries,
and canons are entitled Messere, the professors
Maestro, and the monks Padre.’</p>

<p>Leon Battista Alberti and the pious Fra Giovanni Dominici
speak in similar terms of the respect for parents and
superiors.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> ‘My father,’ Alberti describes his cousin Francesco
as saying, ‘never sat down on public occasions when
his brother, who had received the honour of knighthood, was
present; and he pronounced it as his opinion that one ought
not to sit down in the presence of one’s father or the head
of the family. Your Romans,’ he added, turning to Leon
Battista, ‘who are now ill-conducted in all things (<i>in ogni
cosa mal corretti oggi</i>), have likewise fallen into great error
in this respect: they honour their parents less than their
neighbours, and thus grow up in disorder and vice.’ Fra
Giovanni recommends Madonna Bartolommea degli Obizzi
to teach her children before all things to reverence their
parents, and thus secure earthly happiness. We have before
remarked how Lorenzo impressed on his son the duty of
showing proper respect for his elders; on this point he was
always consistent. The good old habits of strictness were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
also kept up by many distinguished women. In Lorenzo’s
time there are no such charming portraits as those sketched
in his grandfather’s days by the good Vespasiano;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> but
Alessandra de’ Bardi, wife of Lorenzo Strozzi; Francesca
Giacomini Tebalducci, wife of Donato Acciaiuolo; Nanna
Valori, wife of Giannozzo Pandolfini; Caterina Strozzi
Ardinghelli; Saracina Giacomini Acciaiuolo, and others,
could not fail to have worthy successors; and the beautiful
and dignified female portraits which give such a peculiar
charm to Ghirlandajo’s frescoes in Sta. Maria Novella would
alone be enough to prove that the generation had not died
out. Times had become more settled and peaceful, and
since 1478 there had been no sudden overthrow or turn of
fortune such as had hitherto rapidly succeeded each other.
In the undisturbed peace of their homes good women found
ample scope for the practice of the Christian virtues which
had distinguished their mothers and grandmothers, often
widowed or homeless in early youth, amid the stormy days of
trouble.</p>

<p>Knighthood has been frequently alluded to in this work.
While nobility of birth was attended by civil disadvantages,
personal nobility, or knighthood, had a peculiar value of its
own. This distinction was a relic of the romantic days of
Charles the Great. In imitation of kings and emperors the
commonwealth claimed the power of granting it, and in
1288 the first example is said to have occurred in the war
against Pisa. Knighthood was a necessary qualification for
the office of Podestà, and was conferred on those appointed
if they had not previously received it. Knights of this sort
were called <i>Cavalieri di popolo</i>. Two cases of strangely
conferred knighthood occurred in the fourteenth century.
After the rising of the lower classes on July 20, 1378, more
than sixty citizens, with Salvestro de’ Medici at their head,
were knighted at the request of the multitude. When quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
was in some degree restored these knights of the Ciompi, as
they were called, were summoned to declare whether they
wished to keep the dignity thus tumultuously conferred on
them; in which case they were to be knighted over again
by a syndic of the commonwealth who had himself attained
that honour. Thirty-one accepted the offer. On October 15
they assembled in the church of the Annunziata and thence
proceeded, in knightly attire, to the great square; and
there, in presence of the Signoria, the Podestà&mdash;a Venetian
nobleman&mdash;completed the ceremony as syndic of the commonwealth,
whereupon they took the oaths of allegiance and
received from the Gonfalonier their lances, standards, and
shields with the arms of the people.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> On April 26, 1389,
two members of the Panciatichi family, one a child not
much more than four years old, were made knights of the
people. Great honour was shown them, and like Cola
Rienzi in Rome of old, they, with many of their relations
and friends, spent the night in the Baptistery, where seven
great beds were set up; and the next day a banquet took
place in the convent of Sta. Maria Novella<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> at which 250
citizens were present.</p>

<p>The knights of the people were divided into two classes-the
<i>cavalieri di corredo</i>, knighted for civil services, and the
<i>cavalieri di scudo</i> for military ones; the former named from
the banquet which they gave after the ceremony, the latter
from the shield; like the <i>noblesse de robe</i> and <i>noblesse d’épée</i>
in France. Both classes bore on their breasts, or on their
helmets, shields, &amp;c., the arms of the people, usually with the
red lily of the Republic on a round, white escutcheon, sometimes
also with the arms of the Guelf party. Besides these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
there were other knights who had received their dignity
from Popes or foreign sovereigns, especially the kings of
France, on embassies and suchlike occasions; and others
who had been knighted on the battle-field by a commander-in-chief,
as a reward for their bravery. These last were entitled
<i>cavalieri d’arme</i>, to distinguish them from the <i>cavalieri
di scudo</i>. The wearing of the golden spurs, afterwards so
much abused, was the prerogative of these military knights.</p>

<p>Embassies had always been important to the Florentines
in a political point of view, as well as a means of obtaining
personal distinction. In the first jubilee year, when twelve
of them appeared before Pope Boniface VIII. as the representatives
of various states, he called them the fifth element.
They always preserved their reputation as good diplomatists.
Not only did clergy, statesmen, and scholars take an active
part in diplomacy, it was a career open even to the Grandi,
the real nobility who were excluded from all the offices of
state. In the fifteenth century the splendour with which
the embassies were conducted corresponded with the importance
of the state and the personal rank of the ambassadors.
Their posts, however, were not lucrative; for if, as
was the case in 1483, each ambassador received about ten
gold florins a day, the expenses in excess of those which he
could charge for were very heavy. Besides the solemn
embassies on special occasions, there were resident envoys
at Naples, Rome, Milan, and Venice. The former were
numerous and brilliant, and comprised, besides the actual
ambassadors, younger men (who, according to a later regulation,
were not to be under the age of twenty-four), who went
to learn the business of diplomacy and see foreign lands;
there was also a chancellor and other officials. Only two
examples need be referred to for the high honour in which
Florentine embassies were held&mdash;Neri Capponi’s famous
embassy to Venice during the war of the Visconti, and that
to Louis XI. on his accession. ‘Never,’ says Macchiavelli,
‘did that Signoria receive a prince with so much honour as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
they did Neri.’ King Louis, with the Duke of Britanny
and a suite of about forty horsemen, advanced two leagues
from Tours to meet Monsignor Filippo de’ Medici, Piero de’
Pazzi, and Buonaccorso Pitti (Luca’s son), envoys of the
Republic, and kept his hat in his hand because the first-named
would not be covered.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Travelling was slow; the
embassy had left Florence on October 27, and reached Tours
on December 23. With what splendour Piero de’ Pazzi returned
home has been mentioned already.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HOUSE AND FAMILY OF THE MEDICI.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> house of the Medici had not its equal in Florence, probably
not in all Italy. Its inner arrangements corresponded
with its outward stately and beautiful architecture. Three
generations, with the whole world open before them, of
highly-cultivated, art-loving owners had ruled in it. No
other family ever existed in which the love of collecting,
combined with a hearty appreciation of the value and
importance of the most various objects, retained its ardour and
thoroughness through so many centuries, as in the case of
these Florentine merchants, who gradually developed and
grew into a princely house, and intermarried with the royal
houses of Hapsburg, Lorraine, Wittelsbach, and Bourbon.
As in other great historical families, the same traits were
noticeable in all the Medici. Even in the days when several
members of the house fell victims to the curse that eventually
destroyed many of the ruling families of Italy, when the
Medici as a distinct family were fast perishing, though
mourned for by thousands&mdash;even then the surviving members
of the race preserved the many brilliant qualities which had
made their ancestors famous. In every direction they had
relations with grand-dukes and princes; beautiful, curious,
and rare objects of art were sent to them from all quarters of
the globe by their agents, diplomatists, scholars, artists, and
merchants; and in their own country they constantly employed
those who displayed talent, learning, or skill. The
colossal wealth of the Florentine collections, chiefly inheritances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
from the Medici, proves this; and the sudden bankruptcy
which occurred in all these things at their extinction
gives a striking example of the contrast which was brought
about by years.</p>

<p>The history of art and literature from Cosimo’s days
shows what a treasury of paintings, sculptures, coins, engraved
stones, manuscripts, gems, and antiquities of all
kinds were collected together in that house in the Via Larga.
Commines, describing the shameless plunder of the Medici’s
houses begun in November 1494 by the French and continued
by the Florentines,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> estimates the value of the objects destroyed
in one day at 100,000 crowns;&mdash;‘the most beautiful rings,
specimens of agate, admirable cameos, and near three
thousand gold and silver medals, such as no other collection
in Italy could equal.’ Galeazzo Maria Sforza once said that
he, too, could show treasures; but the finest things in all
the world were collected in the house of a private man&mdash;Lorenzo.
And what a quantity had been gathered together
there since the visit of the Milanese Duke! ‘Lorenzo,’ says
Niccolò Valori,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> ‘took the liveliest interest in all things antique.
I have heard from Marsilio that on receiving from Girolamo
Rossi of Pistoja a bust of Plato, found amid the ruins of the
Athenian Academy, his delight was exceeding great, and
he always held that bust in high honour. Those who wished
to do this great man a pleasure vied with each other in
bringing him coins and bronze works distinguished by their
value and workmanship, and antiquities of all sorts, from all
parts of the world. When I came home from Naples I sent
him busts of the Empress Faustina and Africanus and several
beautifully chiselled marbles. I cannot describe the manner
in which he received them. What he had collected from all
quarters he carefully preserved in his house. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
show them to just anybody, but only to those who understood
them, and at festive banquets he adorned his table with
works of art to do honour to his guests. When the excellent
Duke Federigo of Urbino saw these treasures of Lorenzo,
he admired not only the materials and skilful workmanship,
but also the almost incredible number of the objects. He is
said to have thus addressed Lorenzo: ‘How much can love
and perseverance accomplish! I behold, here, a royal
treasure-house; yet one such as no king is able to gather
together, either by money, or power, or rapine.’</p>

<p>These treasures were collected in the most various ways.
Sellers of antiques brought them to Florence or sent them
from a distance. When Paul III.’s rich collection of engraved
and precious stones was sold after his death, a considerable
part of it passed into the hands of the Medici for a
moderate sum, by means of Giovanni Tornabuoni. Lorenzo
himself in his memoirs mentions the marble busts of Augustus
and Agrippa, gifts of Sixtus IV., and the vases of chalcedony
and engraved stones bought in Rome. In 1484, 1488, and
1490, Luigi Lotti of Barberino, Giovan Antonio of Arezzo,
and Andrea of Fojano were commissioned to make purchases
in Rome and Siena.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> On Giuliano da Sangallo’s return from
Naples, King Ferrante gave him a bust of Hadrian, a nude
female statue and a sleeping Cupid, for Lorenzo, who had
sent him to the king.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Messer Zaccaria Barbaro, grateful for
the sympathy shown to his son, sent a precious Greek vase.
Carlo de’ Medici bought antiquities, coins, &amp;c., in Rome.
Besides the manuscripts and objects of art, there were a
quantity of curiosities and handsome household furniture of
all sorts, porcelain and majolica, given by the Malatesta, and,
as Lorenzo wrote,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> more highly prized by him than if they
were of silver, because they were excellent, rare, and, till
then, unknown in Florence. Much of what now adorns the
great Uffizi collection came to Florence in those days. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of the sculptures and larger works of art, however, were not
placed in the house in the Via Larga, where there was no
space for them, but in the neighbouring garden of San Marco.
Opposite the left aisle, near to where the long street joins
the large conventual and other gardens, the Medici had a
casino, to which were attached grounds and plantations extending
as far as the Via San Gallo. Casinos of this kind,
intended for social purposes and walks, were usual among
the great Florentine families even down to the last century.
The whole place has been altered; a century after Lorenzo’s
time, Bernardo Buontalenti built a grand but heavy palace,
which has been lately used for various purposes, and after
the extinction of the Medici, part of the ground was cleared
for the pretty house called Casino della Livia, after a favourite
of the Grand-Duke Leopold I. About the same time the
appearance of the adjoining Piazza San Marco was completely
changed by the new façade of the church, the new front of
the convent, and the building of the Academy of Arts on the
site of Lemmo Balducci’s hospital.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Here, in the alleys of
trees, were set up the antique sculptures, and in the house
were kept the cartoons and pictures which had been collected
in the course of years; here young artists studied from old
and new models. Lorenzo, most eager of collectors, knew
how to appreciate love of art in others. Not only to allied
princes did he give great assistance in this respect. When
Commines returned from his embassy in 1478, he brought
home several beautiful medals of which the ‘Seigneur
Laurens’ had made him a present.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The Medici did not confine their splendour to their town
houses. Lorenzo divided his time between the city and the
country. His appreciation of the beauties of nature made a
sojourn at his villas particularly agreeable to him; and
following the example of his father and grandfather, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
frequently went to stay at Careggi, whose nearness to the
city facilitated the transaction of business; in the hot season
he went up to the more retired and cooler Cafaggiuolo or
Trebbio. After Careggi, however, his favourite abode was
Poggio a Cajano. Half way between Florence and Pistoja,
ten miles from either city, on a low hill, the last on the
north-eastern slope of the Monte Albano, which separates
the plain of Pistoja from the valley of the Nievole and the
lower part of that of the Arno, stands Sangallo’s handsome
building, overlooking the green and fruitful valley watered
by the Ombrone, and made famous by Lorenzo’s poem of
‘Ambra.’ Travellers may now wander through the well-cultivated
grounds of the farm, and the park, twenty or
thirty years ago still full of gold pheasants, the descendants
of those procured by Lorenzo from Sicily; or cross the stream
by means of a suspension-bridge. The beauty of the place,
and the admirable arrangements made for purposes of husbandry
by the owner of the villa, were described by Poliziano
at the end of his ‘Ambra’ (composed in 1485), and by Michele
Verino in a letter to Simone Canigiani. An aqueduct brought
water from the neighbouring height of Bonistallo. Besides
the vegetable and fruit gardens there were large mulberry
plantations for rearing silk-worms, still a profitable business
in that district. On the low uplands were large stalls, paved
with stone for the sake of cleanliness, and with their four
turrets resembling little fortresses; here was kept a whole
herd of fine cows which fed on the rich pasture-lands and
supplied the city of Florence with cheese, an article which
hitherto had had to be fetched from Lombardy. There were
plenty of calves and sheep; a breed of uncommonly large
pigs had been got from Calabria, and a breed of rabbits from
Spain. Birds of all kinds abounded, particularly water-fowl
and quails. The quantity of water made the soil fruitful,
but there was ample provision for manure.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> It is interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to see the statesman and patron of literature and art occupied
with agricultural interests, a liking for which he had inherited
from his grandfather, and to which he was specially attracted
by his strong feeling for nature.</p>

<p>Down to our own time the villa of Poggio a Cajano has
kept up these traditions side by side with its historic reminiscences.
The very ancient and noble family of the Cadolingi
of Fucecchio had property here which passed to the powerful
Pistojan family of the Cancellieri, and in 1420, by sale, to
Palla Strozzi.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> How and when the Medici came into possession
of it is unknown. That it should have changed
hands twice in a century is nothing astonishing, considering
the vicissitudes of families in those eventful times. Nowhere
is one so vividly reminded as here of Lorenzo il Magnifico,
who actually built the place as it is now. When his second
son had mounted the Papal chair, he caused the great hall to
be decorated with frescoes representing scenes from the old
Roman world, and containing allusions to home events.
Paolo Giovio, a client of the Pope and of Cardinal Giulio
de’ Medici, chose the subjects; the animals bringing tribute
to Cæsar were painted by Andrea del Sarto; the triumph of
Cicero, which Poggio Bracciolini had compared to the return
of Cosimo, by Franciabigo; and some mythological representations
by Jacopo da Pontormo. Leo’s death interrupted
the work, which was completed in 1580 by Alessandro Allori.
In a Pietà forming the altar-piece of the village church
Giorgio Vasari placed the two patron saints of the Medici
beside the dead Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>In these stately and beautiful localities, both in the city
and country, active, energetic, comfortable, and cheerful life
went on its way in spite of a few natural troubles. Lorenzo
never gave himself up to senseless luxury such as many
princes and cardinals indulged in; but he was always a
grand gentleman in the true sense of the words. He never
forgot that he was a Florentine citizen, as he loved to describe
himself; his correspondents adopted the same idea of
him, and he impressed the fact strongly upon his sons.
At the same time he never forgot that at home all eyes were
fixed on him, and that abroad it was he who represented the
State. In his house and his villas there was perpetual
movement. Everybody and everything went to and fro in
the house of the man who stood at the head of all. Besides
politics, he was constantly engaged with family affairs and
intercourse with scholars and artists. He had many relations,
and made good use of some of them. Numerous families
were intimately connected with his. Many were made great
by him; others, great already, he tried to attach more and
more to himself. He stood godfather to his own countrymen
as well as to foreign princes. When in 1490, Duke Alfonso
of Calabria consented to be sponsor for the son of Giuliano
Gondi, a business friend of the Medici, he asked Lorenzo to
act as proxy for him.</p>

<p>The Medici in some degree kept open house. We learn
from the life of Michelangelo that whosoever was present
at the beginning of the dinner took his seat after the master
of the house, each according to his rank; and the arrangement
of the table was not altered for those who came later,
even though they were of higher rank. All the inmates of
the house who were not servants dined together; the young
Buonarotti, then in the earliest days of his apprenticeship,
was a constant guest at his patron’s table.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Besides the
Academic and other learned symposia, banquets were frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
given, both in the city and at Careggi, in honour of
distinguished foreigners or ambassadors, and on festive occasions.
Cristoforo Landino has left an account of a banquet
which was something between a dinner of scholars and a
feast, and was given by Lorenzo in his young days, when a
noble Greek named Philotimos, who traced his pedigree up
to the time of Constantine and prided himself greatly thereon,
came to Florence accompanied by an Athenian philosopher
named Aretophilos, to condole with the young Medici on the
death of his father. Lorenzo rode out four miles to meet
his guests, and conducted them to his house, where he had
assembled the most distinguished literary men and the friends
of the family. Among the company were Gentile Becchi,
Antonio degli Agli, Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, Leon Battista
Alberti, Ficino, Landino, Poliziano, Argyropulos, his pupils
Piero and Donato Acciaiuolo, and Alamanno Rinuccini. The
discourse at table and the claims of the proud Greek furnished
Landino with the materials for his treatise on true nobility,
which he dedicated to Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> On these and suchlike occasions
the hospitality was on a grand and brilliant scale;
but on ordinary days Lorenzo kept his table within the
modest limits befitting a citizen. So Franceschetto Cybò
discovered when he came on a visit in June 1488. Roman
lords and a number of other people accompanied the
Pope’s son; they wished to see the splendour of the house
of Medici, of which all the world spoke so much. Franceschetto
stayed in his father-in-law’s house; a fine palace was
assigned to his companions. After a few days passed in
festivities, the visitor found a simple table. He wondered;
and when the dinner and supper were served in the same
style, he began to suspect that his companions might be
treated in the same way. The suspicion troubled him,
knowing as he did with what expectations they had come
to Florence. He was therefore delighted to learn that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
continued to be most sumptuously entertained. Talking
confidentially with his father-in-law he mentioned the circumstance,
whereupon Lorenzo quietly answered that he had
received him into his house as a son and was treating him
as such; to act otherwise would be to make a stranger of
him. The noble lords who had come with him to celebrate
his marriage were strangers; Lorenzo was treating them
accordingly, as became his position and theirs.</p>

<p>At the end of 1482 an illustrious German guest came to
the Medici house: Eberhard the Bearded Count of Würtemberg,
son-in-law of Lodovico Gonzaga, Marquis of
Mantua, a connection which formed a natural introduction
to friendly relations with the Medici.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The count’s learned
companions have been already mentioned. Eberhard surveyed
the riches of the house, the handsome halls filled with
plate and other valuables, the library, the terrace with its
evergreen fruit-trees and the stables. What he saw here
must have been a source of great enjoyment to this highly
accomplished prince, who combined a love of native literature
with a knowledge of antiquity, possessed a fine library,
and four years before had conferred a lasting benefit on his
admiring country by founding the university of Tübingen.
He saw the whole family, Lorenzo and his sons, Clarice and
her daughters, still all together in those days. He openly
expressed his pleasure at everything, both the house and its
inhabitants. When he admired the collection of books,
greatly increased and with much discrimination since
Cosimo’s days, Lorenzo, with a play on the words <i>libri</i> and
<i>liberi</i>, answered that his children were his greatest treasures.
From Florence Eberhard went to Rome, where Sixtus IV.
presented him with the golden rose.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The German prince admired Lorenzo’s stud, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
doubt with justice. Lorenzo had a passion for riding-horses,
hunters, and racers. Presents, purchases, and borrowing
of horses occur over and over again in his correspondence.
In October 1488 he bought twenty mares at
Naples, and only a short time before his death horses for
him were on their way from Egypt and the coast of Barbary.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
The taste of the Florentines for horse-racing, with or without
riders, and for which even in those days there were
regular horse-lenders, has been preserved down to our own
time; in the house of the Alessandri is shown a room whose
walls are entirely covered with brocades won as prizes by a
horse belonging to the family. Lorenzo always kept race-horses;
one in particular, called Morello from its dark
colour, always came off victorious, and was so attached to
its master that it showed signs of illness when he did not
feed it with his own hand, and testified its joy at his approach
by stamping and loud neighing.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> In his young days a
handsome Sicilian horse was presented to him, and its value
was outdone by that of the presents he gave in return. He
himself made presents of horses. In November 1479, when
he was particularly anxious to keep on good terms with
Lodovico il Moro, he sent to Roberto Sanseverino, who was
at that time a confidant of the Moro, a fine horse and a
falcon.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Letters about their horses passed between Lorenzo
and King Ferrante, the Este family, the Sforzas of Pesaro,
and others. In January 1473 the king thanked Lorenzo
for the gift of a horse about which his ambassador, Marino
Tomacelli, had written to him. Four years after he announced
that he was sending Lorenzo two racers, a Sicilian
and another, from his own stud, and two hunters, as tokens
of his attachment. Horses of the king’s, lent for the
Florentine races, were on their way at the time of the Pazzi
catastrophe.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> It was, moreover, the custom to send horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to allied nobles and cities, to keep them for the races;
those of the Medici went to both Ferrara and Lucca.
When Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro was going to be married
to Maddalena Gonzaga at the end of the summer
of 1489, he begged Lorenzo to lend him one of his horses
for the tournament to be held on the occasion. In
Lorenzo’s latter years his eldest son had the direction of the
stables.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo has left in his pretty and cheerful description
of the hawking-party a graceful memorial of his love of the
sport. Hawking was an old pastime always in great favour
with princes and nobles. Dante’s master, Brunetto Latini,
mentions in his ‘Treasury’ seven species of falcons which
served for the chase. Two contemporaries of Lorenzo paid
special attention to the training of these birds: the King of
Naples, who imported the best falcons from Rhodes with the
permission of the grand-master of the Hospitallers, and Ercole
d’Este, to whom Lorenzo gave leave to catch the birds on his
estates in the Pisan territory. In return for this the duke sent
to Lorenzo some of his own well-trained falcons for the purpose
of the chase or to help in training his wild ones, and the
king several times made him presents of hawks, as he did
also to Maximilian of Austria, Ferdinand of Castile, Galeazzo
Maria Sforza, and others.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The wide, well-wooded and
watered plain of Pisa, and the lowlands and hills round
Poggio a Cajano, were the scenes of the chase. On December
1, 1475, Angelo Poliziano, who was seldom absent from
either studies or sports, wrote from Pisa to Madonna Clarice,
then expecting her confinement (the child was afterwards
Pope Leo):<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> ‘Yesterday we went hawking. It was windy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and we were unlucky, for we lost Pilato’s falcon called
Mantovano. To-day we tried again, and again the wind
was contrary; yet we had some fine flights, for Maestro
Giorgio let loose his falcon, which returned obediently at a
given signal. Lorenzo is quite in love with the bird, and
not without justice, for Maestro Giorgio says he has never
seen one larger or finer, and he hopes to make him the best
falcon in the world. While we were in the field Pilato returned
from the shore with the truant of yesterday, which
redoubled Lorenzo’s pleasure. We are hawking from morning
till night, and do nothing else. On Monday I hear our
sport is to be varied by a deer-hunt.’</p>

<p>Independently of hunting, Lorenzo liked being in Pisa,
and it was not his fault that the unfortunate city’s relations
with Florence did not improve, and that she could not accustom
herself to bear the position of a subject city. Even
when not called there by business, he frequently stayed there.
From his youth up he was in the habit of leaving Florence
to meet friends for change, for hunting or to see after his
great estate at Agnano. This place, first a fortress and
then a villa round which had gathered a population of a few
hundreds, lies on the western slope of the Monte San Giuliano,
four miles from Pisa, near marshes which Valori says Lorenzo
would have drained if he had lived longer, and which mostly
are drained now. A large pine-wood forms part of the
estate, which in Lorenzo’s days furnished a considerable
quantity of corn and oil, and with other possessions in the
Maremma of Pisa, at Colle Salvetti (now one of the stations
on the railway which passes through the plain to Civita
Vecchia), at Colmezzano, and other places, formed a most
important part of the Medici landed property. Lorenzo’s
letters bear testimony to the great care he took in the improvement
of husbandry in this hitherto sadly neglected
part. Like Spedaletto, Agnano passed to Maddalena Cybò;
her son Lorenzo, who was not on very good terms with his
wife&mdash;Ricciarda Malaspina, heiress of Massa and Carrara&mdash;ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
his days there in 1549.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> After Lorenzo had re-established
the University of Pisa, its interests frequently
called him to the city. During the disastrous fight for
Sarzana he made Pisa a sort of head-quarters. The house
then inhabited by the Medici, now belonging to the Pieracchi
family, stands not far from the upper bridge over the Arno&mdash;the
Ponte della Fortezza&mdash;on the right bank, near the church
of San Matteo. Here is said to have occurred, seventy years
after Lorenzo’s death, that domestic tragedy which has
never been cleared up, and which casts a dark shadow over
the history of the first Medicean grand-duke.</p>

<p>In Lorenzo’s days the house was more cheerful. Here,
probably, was the scene of his discourse with Federigo of
Aragon on Italian poetry; here he passed some pleasant
days in April 1476. He came by San Miniato, where a halt
was always made, with six-and-twenty horses. ‘We rode
along,’ wrote Poliziano to Clarice,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> ‘singing, and sometimes
talking theology in order not to forget this season of fasting;
Lorenzo was triumphant. At San Miniato we tried to read
some of St. Augustine, but the reading was soon exchanged
for music and for polishing up a figure of a dancer which
we found there.’ There was no lack of merriment and jesting
wherever Lorenzo went; the Pisan students found him
a ready supporter of their carnaval gaieties, at which they
were permitted to take away the instruction-books from the
professors and to spend on festivities the money paid to
ransom them. The attribution to Lorenzo of the combat on
the middle bridge over the Arno (<i>Giuoco del Ponte</i>), at which
the ground was disputed between armed bands on either
side, and which was forbidden by the Grand-Duke Leopold
I. on account of its fatal episodes, is a mistake; traces
of it may be found in much earlier times.</p>

<p>It was in Pisa, at the end of May 1477, that Lorenzo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
received Eleonora of Aragon, wife of Duke Ercole of Ferrara;
she had come by way of Lucca to attend her father’s marriage
at Naples, whither she was conveyed by a royal fleet
which had anchored at Livorno.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> As long as Filippo de’ Medici
was Archbishop of Pisa, and his brother Tanai dwelt
there, there was no lack of grand hospitality; Luigi Pulci
mentions the festivities during the presence of the Duke of
Calabria in the war of Colleone.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Other than cheerful purposes
called Lorenzo to Pisa. He sought in its mild air
relief from physical sufferings; as in the autumn of 1474,
after being cured of fever by the waters of Porretta. He
stopped at Pisa, at a critical moment of his life, before embarking
for Naples. In the little church of Sta. Maria della
Spina, whose spires and pinnacles are seen adjoining the
quay on the south shore, in 1485 he ordered for the victims
of the Sarzana struggle requiems to be sung, at which he was
present together with the widow of Bongianni Gianfigliazzi,
who had met his death in the unhealthy air of the Lunigiana
coast.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo’s visits to the baths played a great part in his
life, though they never took him beyond the borders of
Tuscany. Gout was hereditary in his family; his grandfather,
his father, and his uncle all suffered from it, and his
mother too was not exempt. When only twenty-six he was
obliged to take the waters of Porretta, which still attract so
many invalids to the valley of the Reno in the Apennines,
on the road between Pistoja and Bologna. His most frequent
resort was Bagno a Morba, where Madonna Lucrezia
had a house and stayed frequently, and in his latter years
he had the water sent to Spedaletto. Most of the Tuscan
baths were anything but inviting; some are not more so
now. In the Roman territory they are still worse; Ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Matteo Franco, describing the baths of Stigliano near the
lake of Bracciano, remarks that in comparison with this
place Bagno a Morba was a Careggi. Lorenzo tried other
medicinal waters. In the autumn of 1484, after the taking
of Pietrasanta, he went to the baths of San Filippo in the
Sienese country. These remarkable thermal springs are
reached by turning out of the old Roman high-road at the
little village of Ricorsi, at the foot of the inhospitable height
of Radicofani, and proceeding through the valley of the
Orcia towards the stately group of Mont’Amiata, covered
throughout its 5,000 feet of height with chestnuts and
beeches, and surrounded with a girdle of villages. The
springs lie in a deep ravine encircled with woods; a precipitate
of carbonic acid and lime forms a marble-like crust,
and the waters are an efficacious remedy for arthritic disorders
as well as for skin-diseases. It is a desolate place,
with only a few houses destined for the reception of invalids,
in the narrow valley where oppressive heat alternates with a
damp cold atmosphere. In autumn of the following year,
and several times afterwards, Lorenzo came again. In the
spring of 1490 he spent some time at the baths of Vignone
in the same valley of the Orcia, a little southwards of San
Quirico. Powerful thermal springs, similar to those mentioned
above, issue from a travertine hill in the middle of
the village, and fill a large basin; they were known in
Roman times. Here Ermolao Barbaro visited Lorenzo, and
Franceschetto Cybò and his wife kept him company; at that
season the place was safe, but in summer the air can hardly
be borne even by natives. Lorenzo’s stay at Filetto in the
valley of the Merse has already been mentioned. All these
water-cures only gave temporary relief to his malady, and
the short time he usually devoted to them would have prevented
any lasting result even if his maladies had been less
rooted and less complicated. Besides, even after his health
had suffered considerably, his mode of life was not exactly
regular. He not only exerted himself too much in attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to business of all kinds, public and private, which poured in
upon him surrounded as he was by many cares, but he was
always involved in love intrigues. Bartolommea de’ Nasi,
the wife of Donato Benci, held him in her chains for years;
she was neither young nor beautiful, but graceful and attractive.
Even in winter he would ride out in the evening to
her villa to be back in the city before daybreak. Two confidants,
Luigi della Stufa and Andrea de’ Medici, were his
usual companions. They got tired of it, and their remarks
came to the ears of the lady; whereupon she managed to
have them punished by being sent off on diplomatic errands,
the one to Cairo and the other to Constantinople&mdash;an old
and well-worn contrivance which, in this case, caused a sensation
of a nature not very favourable to the great man,
‘who behaved himself like an inexperienced youth.’<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>The princely dignity which Lorenzo enjoyed was as
apparent in his relations with foreign rulers as in his position
in his own country, in his own house, and in his journeys.
The former have been repeatedly mentioned. Everyone
made use of him; everyone applied to him; everyone
gave him thanks and presents, from antiquities down to
sweet-smelling essences, which the Duchess of Calabria sent
him. He sent his friends and acquaintances presents of
books, works of art, horses, wine, and other things. In
June 1489 he presented a vase full of balm to Anne de
Beaujeu, ‘Madama di Belgiù.’ Venison and fish seem to
have been favourite gifts on the part of communities and
individuals; on one day five wild boars were taken to
Lorenzo’s house.</p>

<p>A great event, which has left its trace in the history of
art by a representation in a fresco at Poggio a Cajano, was
an embassy from Abu Nasr Kaitbei, Sultan of Egypt, or
of Babylonia as he was called, which arrived at Florence on
November 11, 1487, and was honourably and joyfully received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
by the foreign ambassadors and many of the citizens.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
It was a fortunate time for the Republic, which had a few
months before got rid of the dreary affair of Sarzana, and
had now entered on a period of comparative peace which
was not disturbed till the revolution of 1494. Italian affairs
were of considerable importance to the Egyptian sultan, not
only on account of commerce but also politically, on account
of his relations with Naples and Venice; difficulties with
this latter state might easily have been created by the
sultan’s claims to the suzerainty of Cyprus, where Caterina
Cornaro continued to reign as a queen of shadows till 1489,
under the protection of Venice. The sultan’s eyes often
turned towards the west as the progress of the Osmanli
threatened an attack on the loosely connected empire of the
Mamelukes, which, indeed, fell before their better-compacted
power within less than thirty years. After the subjection
of Pisa, Florence had frequent commercial relations with
Egypt, and a desire to enlarge and secure its privileges
gave rise to negotiations for which an Egyptian ambassador
named Malphet came to Florence in 1487, and in the following
year a Florentine, the aforesaid Luigi della Stufa, went
to Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The former was sent at once to the Signoria of
the Republic and to the ‘Hakim’ (lord) Lorenzo de’ Medici,
and brought rich presents for both. On Sunday, November
18, he had a solemn audience of the Signoria in presence of
many of the chief citizens. He had led before him a giraffe
and a tame lion, gifts from the sultan. The giraffe was no
novelty to the Florentines, for one had been already seen at
the festivals with which the visit of Pius II. was celebrated;
and the lion, the emblem of the commonwealth, was always
carefully kept here, alive as well as in effigy. A street
behind the palace of the Signoria took its name from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
lion-cage, afterwards removed to the square of San Marco.
A Sicilian interpreter translated the conversation, which
turned on the privileges offered to the Florentines in Egypt
and Syria. For Lorenzo the ambassador brought gifts of
various kinds: an Arabian horse, rare animals, among
which were rams and sheep of various colours, with long
hanging ears and tails; several horns of civet, a lamp with
balsam, a quantity of aloe-wood, beautiful many coloured
porcelain such as had never before been seen, vases of preserves,
and rich and finely woven silk and linen stuffs.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
There was a great festival in the Medici household when all
these rarities were brought home; Madonna Clarice was
absent, being then at Rome with Maddalena. Among
Lorenzo’s gifts to the sultan is mentioned a bed, carried by
a special messenger.</p>

<p>Whenever Lorenzo went to the baths or left home for
any purpose, he was everywhere received like a prince.
The municipalities within the Florentine dominions were
accustomed to send yearly presents to the capital on certain
feasts, and they did not neglect to send offerings to the head
of the Republic. After the fashion of the times these gifts
usually consisted of provisions and goods for the house.
When Lorenzo was expected, early in 1485, at San Gemignano,
on his way to Bagno a Morba, but took another route,
the municipality, which had voted 100 lire for his reception,
sent to Morba a load of Greek wine, capons, marchpane and
wax.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The Signoria of Siena, though they had not a few
complaints against Lorenzo, honoured him in a similar manner
when he was in their territory. During his stay at
Vignone they sent ample provisions for his table.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> His suite
was unusually numerous. A list of the persons he once
took with him to Morba<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> names the following: a chaplain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Filippo (Ubaldini) da Gagliano, Francesco degli Organi
(Squarcialupi), a house-steward, two chancellors (secretaries),
two singers, Bertoldo the sculptor, a barber, two valets, a
butler, five crossbowmen, ten grooms, an equerry, a cook, a
kitchen-boy, and a coachman. For these thirty-two persons
fourteen beds were required. His family, too, when they
travelled without him, were everywhere received in the most
distinguished manner possible. A letter of their faithful,
cheerful friend, Matteo Franco, gives a lively sketch of a
journey on horseback made by Clarice in May 1485, from
Morba, where she had been with her husband, through the
Volterra district and the Elsa valley to Florence. At all the
places where she stopped, especially at Colle, where the first
halt for sleeping was made (the second was at Passignano,
where stood the great abbey given to Giovanni de’ Medici),
everybody was astir; yet friendly intercourse was combined
with a ceremonious reception.</p>

<p>Whether in town, in the country, or on a journey, Lorenzo
was always surrounded by friends, whose names are inseparable
from his. Most of them have become known in the
course of this history; various characters, of whom more
than one may be differently judged, according to whether
we view them in private life and in their confidential relations,
or as public men, authors or otherwise. First come
those who were the guides of his youth or whom he knew in
his father’s house; Gentile Becchi, who remained a member
of the Medicean household even after his appointment to the
see of Arezzo, as bishops were not required to reside too
strictly; Ficino, Landino, and Poliziano. Then those who,
having been friends of his parents, attached themselves to
him in his youth and manhood; or those who first came in
contact with him in his mature years; Luigi Pulci, Matteo
Franco, Bartolommeo Scala, Pico della Mirandola&mdash;besides
those who were drawn to him by political and allied interests,
and who zealously served him and, in his sense of the word,
the State, without forgetting themselves. On each and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Lorenzo had a deep and lasting influence; he was the centre
around which all revolved, the link that bound all together,
however much a few of the disaffected ones might try to
fight against it. Their attachment to him was not forced
or selfish; the affection expressed in Pulci’s letters and
Poliziano’s verses had nothing artificial about it. Lorenzo
was a genial man, cordial and kind, a born prince, simple
and natural. In his intercourse with the scholars and artists
who were in some sense dependent on him, the relation of
patron and client was forgotten. Their letters to him, grave
and gay, are proofs of their confidence and intimacy. If they
address him as ‘Magnifico,’ they soon follow it up with a
plain ‘Lorenzo.’ In the midst of the war-troubles of 1479,
Donatello’s pupil Bertoldo wrote Lorenzo a letter full of fun,
to the effect that it was more profitable to be a cook than
an artist;<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> and the famous Niccolò Grosso, called Caparra,
in reality a blacksmith, but who executed works of art, would
not fulfil Lorenzo’s orders till he had executed others he
had received first.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> How entirely constraint was banished
in intercourse with him is shown by his conversation with
the mosaic-worker Graffione, a pupil of Baldovinetti. Lorenzo
once said he would like to adorn the inside of the dome of
the Cathedral with mosaics. ‘For that you could not get
masters,’ replied Graffione. ‘We have money enough to
get masters,’ was the probably half-jesting answer. ‘Eh,
Lorenzo,’ exclaimed the artist, ‘it is not the money that
procures the masters, but the masters who procure the
money!’ He bore with their humours and oddities; he
honoured them living and dead, feeling that their fame
would add to his own. Had he done nothing for art beyond
the cordial and almost fatherly reception which he, a powerful
and much-envied man of mature years, gave to Michelangelo
when the latter was almost in his boyhood, that
alone would make his memory illustrious. On his death-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
he desired once more to see the friends in whose society he
had passed his happiest hours, and whose attachment followed
him beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding many disturbances caused by political
events, increasing bad health, and several deaths in the
family, still life was cheerful in the Medici household.
Music was a daily pleasure. Lorenzo’s poetical talents attached
him to this art, and his unmusical voice did not hinder
him from taking a part in singing. Marsilio relates that he
did so at a social gathering which apparently took its name
of <i>La Mammola</i> (the Violet) from a still existing hostelry.
Thus, too, one evening, when he was singing the mysteries
of love, he originated a discussion as to whether subjects in
which mourning occurred were appropriate, which Ficino
decided in the affirmative.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> In his poetical productions he
reckoned much on musical effect, a necessary condition of
songs for dancing and for the carnaval. As long as his
health permitted he was never absent from the merry processions
at which popular melodies alternated with those of
Heinrich Isaak; and on journeys, at the May-festivals and
other times of gaiety there was no lack of musical accompaniments
to the verses of Poliziano and other friends. Although
from Guido Aretino down to the father of Galileo, Tuscany
produced no remarkable composer or writer on music, yet
the people were always musical. Ficino was doubly welcome
when he appeared with his plectrum, after the pattern of
the earliest half-deified apostles of Greek culture, to secure
a better reception for ancient philosophy by his strains delighting
the ear and winning the heart. As in Poliziano’s
‘Orpheus,’ Baccio Ugolini accompanied on the lyre the ode
in praise of Cardinal Gonzaga, so did Marsilio when extemporising,
in which art he was a master.</p>

<p>One of Lorenzo’s protégés was the organ-builder Antonio
Squarcialupi, who, as a precentor, had been a familiar of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
house in Piero’s time. His life and conversation seem not
to have been blameless; but Lorenzo took him under his
protection for the sake of his uncommon talent. ‘If you
knew,’ he said once to those who blamed him, ‘what it is to
attain perfection in anything, you would judge him more
gently and modestly.’<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Squarcialupi set to music many of
the songs of his patron, who, it is said, composed the inscription
for his tomb. To the friendship of the Medici he owed
the epigram in which Poliziano called upon Florence to
honour with a marble monument him who had long been
the voice of her temple.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The man really must have possessed
rare artistic merits; for a son of the Count of Altavilla&mdash;one
of the guests at the Salutati banquet&mdash;came to Florence
with an introduction from King Ferrante to Lorenzo, to
study the organ and other instruments under Squarcialupi;
and ten years later a clergyman named Stephen came from
Ofen, with a recommendation from Matthias Corvinus, to
learn organ-building.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> In 1477 a lute-player of Lodovico
Sforza’s suite came to Florence to be heard by the famous
master.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Organ-building, as well as organ-playing, was a
somewhat rare art. The difficulty of finding good masters
is shown by the trouble and loss of time caused in Cosimo’s
days to the committee entrusted with the building of the
Cathedral, through the untrustworthiness of Matteo da Prato,
who had undertaken to furnish the new organs, to be decorated
by Donatello and Luca della Robbia. Lorenzo took
great interest in this branch of music. Many of his letters
relate to organists recommended by him to various Tuscan
towns, or sent from one place to another. At his death there
were in his house no less than five organs; one large one
with a finely-carved wooden case, the rest smaller, partly
metal, partly paste-board, which was then used for these instruments.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Musicians were included among the servants;
and in the evenings there was singing and playing on the
lute. Michelangelo in his later years used to tell of a man
who was called the <i>Cardiere</i>, and who was a great favourite
with Lorenzo on account of his wonderful talent for improvising
songs to an instrumental accompaniment.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Lorenzo
also looked after the musical education of his children. ‘The
evening before last,’ wrote Poliziano to him at Bagno a
Morba on June 5, 1490,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> ‘I unexpectedly heard our Piero
sing, and then he and his companions came to my room.
He pleased me exceedingly, especially in the motetts and
answers to the strophes, and also by his charms of articulation.
I felt as if I were listening to your Magnificence.’
Leo X. had through life a true passion for music and improvisation.
As a cardinal, his palace near Sant’Eustachio
(Palazzo Madama) continually resounded with instruments
and singing; and in the Vatican music and poetry vied with
each other, and both improvisers and musicians made their
fortunes with the Pope.</p>

<p>It is needless to repeat how closely poetry was intertwined
with the life of the Medici. The taste for it was hereditary.
Cosimo the elder, Lorenzo, his brother Giuliano, all wrote
poetry; so did the younger Piero and others of the family.
As a child Lorenzo’s daughter Lucrezia knew by heart
the spiritual songs of her grandmother;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and the songs of
the ‘Morgante’ were first heard in the Medici house when
Lucrezia Tornabuoni took part in them. Many of Poliziano’s
poems were evidently intended to be recited to his patron;
and when he relates in a letter<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> how one asked him for
sermons for the brotherhoods, another for carnaval songs,
one wanted sentimental songs for the viola, another gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
serenades, it is probable that he referred to members of the
society he met in the house of the Medici. One can fancy
Pulci and Matteo Franco sending satirical shafts in the form
of sonnets at each other across the table. In the ‘Beoni’
and ‘Nencia,’ evidently intended for gay meetings, Lorenzo
himself gave the signal for poetical entertainments and contests;
Pulci once answered him with the ‘Beca da Dicomano.’
The poetic gifts of his eldest son are displayed in the latter’s
productions; the verses written by him in exile show more
depth of feeling than one would have given him credit for.
In his youth, at least, his contemporaries seem to have judged
him favourably. In a sonnet of Antonio da Pistoja on the
poets of the time, both Piero and his father are mentioned,
and the praise bestowed on them gains weight from the fact
that Poliziano alone is placed above them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">Who among Tuscans doth in verse excel?<br />
In vulgar tongue? Aye, and in Latin speech.<br />
Lorenzo and his son write passing well,<br />
But neither can Politian’s glory reach.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Piero’s letters to his father, on literary and other subjects,
display sound judgment, information, and lively interest.
His boyish letters, indeed, are of little consequence; and
when, as a lad of fourteen, he writes from the villa to his
father at San Filippo, giving an account of his own studies
and those of his brother Giovanni, with whom he was reading
Virgil’s Bucolics, thereby, as he said, gaining double profit,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
his master’s hand is clearly traceable. But there are other
letters worthy of consideration, such as that on the visit of
Ermolao Barbaro. Although Poliziano’s descriptions of his
pupil and of the young Cardinal Giovanni lose much of their
effect and even spoil their subjects by exaggeration, yet it cannot
be disputed that Lorenzo’s eldest son, though he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
possess his father’s prudence and calculation (a want which
may perhaps be explained and excused by the degree of
splendour, fortune, and grandeur at which Lorenzo left the
personal government in his hands), yet did possess many of
his intellectual qualities. The time during which he continued
to hold the government was too short and too much
disturbed by preludes of the coming storm to furnish
premisses for a decisive judgment of him; neither can
such a judgment be fairly founded on his conduct in exile,
which may be mistaken even by the keenest eye.</p>

<p>Piero’s wife can hardly have had a good influence on him.
Alfonsina Orsini was infinitely less fitted than her mother-in-law
for Florentine life and manners. In her nature the
pride of the Roman barons seems to have been combined
with covetousness and hardness, whereby she made herself
very much disliked in later years, when her brother-in-law
was Pope and she was a great deal in Rome, where she died
in 1520. Her husband’s three sisters, Lucrezia, Maddalena,
and Contessina, the wife of Piero Ridolfi, were frequently at
their father’s house. Maddalena, whose daughter Lucrezia
was born at Rome early in 1490, became at Florence, on
August 24 of the following year, the mother of a son who
was christened Innocenzo after the Pope, received the red
hat from Leo X., and, with his cousins Cardinals Salviati
and Ridolfi, played some part in Florence after the murder
of the first duke. All three sisters afterwards attached
themselves to the court of Leo X. in a way which threw no
favourable light on his financial arrangements; and the influence
of Lucrezia, doubtless the most highly gifted of the
three, lasted beyond her brother’s lifetime throughout the
whole reign of her cousin Clement VII., with whom her
husband, Jacopo Salviati (father of the cardinal), was very
intimate, till the Pope’s proceedings in 1529 against the
city of his fathers estranged the relatives. In one of Ariosto’s
satires, invaluable for a study of the manners and general
circumstances of the early years of the sixteenth century, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
introduces Lorenzo’s posterity and their friends rejoicing at
the elevation of Leo X.,&mdash;a rejoicing destined to be of short
duration.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> There were numerous other members of the
family, rich and poor, nearly and distantly connected. The
nearest branch was, of course, that descended from Cosimo’s
brother Lorenzo, whose chief representative at this time was
the oft-mentioned Lorenzo, son of Pier Francesco. One of
those admitted to the closest intimacy was a distant cousin,
Andrea. As long as the daughters remained at home
Lorenzo insisted on their dressing modestly and simply, in
conformity to the sumptuary laws. Certain materials he
never would allow them, because they resembled the forbidden
crimson cloth, although many other grand ladies
wore them without scruple. He himself was never distinguished
from other citizens in outward apparel. In
winter he wore a violet mantle with a hood, and in summer
the <i>lucco</i>: the long red robe of the upper class of citizens,
still the usual dress of the magistrates. It is mentioned
that he got Venetian silk for his dress. To elderly people
he always offered his hand and gave the place of honour,
and what he taught his sons he first followed himself.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s observations generally were very pointed without
falling into the sarcasm of his grandfather. When the
Sienese jurist Bartolommeo Sozzini repeated the old reproach
against the air of Florence that it was bad for the sight (‘An
ancient saying calls her people blind’) before Lorenzo, who
suffered from weak eyes, Lorenzo replied that the air of
Siena was worse still; it was bad for the brains. When the
same man, having broken his plighted word in leaving Pisa
secretly, on being caught and imprisoned complained of
the punishment as unbecoming his position, Lorenzo answered
that the dishonour was not in the punishment but in
the unworthy action. He said of those who built recklessly
that they were buying repentance dear; and when his cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Pier Francesco, having begun at Majano a building which
he kept on altering as the work proceeded, complained that
the expense far exceeded the estimate, he exclaimed: ‘No
wonder; others build according to their plans, you make
your plans after the building.’ When Carlo de’ Medici,
who seems not to have been over-nice in his methods of getting
money, boasted of the quantity of water round his villa,
Lorenzo remarked that he would have to keep his hands
all the cleaner. That he also had a turn for practical
joking, which, as has been seen, was an ingredient in Florentine
life, is shown by the history of the troublesome parasitical
doctor Maestro Manente, whom he caused to be taken
one evening, when drunk, by two men in disguise, and shut
up in a place unknown to him outside the city, and given
out for dead. When the supposed dead man at last got
home, his wife, who took him for a ghost, would not let him
in till the enchantment of which he was supposed to have
been the victim was cleared up by the intervention of others.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
This trick evidently recalls the story of the fat cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>In a letter to Lodovico Odasio, Poliziano has left a
description of his patron and friend in graver conversation.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
‘Think not that any one of our learned brethren, even those
whose very life’s work is study, can surpass Lorenzo de’
Medici in acuteness of disputation and in formulating a conclusion;
or that he is inferior to anyone in the easy, graceful,
and varied expression of his ideas. Historical examples
occur to him as readily as to the most accomplished of his
companions; and whenever the subject of the discourse
admits of it, his conversation is richly seasoned with the salt
of the ocean from which Venus rose.’ Poliziano, the confidential
friend of the house, who was never absent either
from the literary symposia or from the narrower circle of
friends, in time of joy or in time of mourning, understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Lorenzo thoroughly, and his judgment may be accepted.
Many of Lorenzo’s sayings have been preserved which bear
witness to the soundness of his judgment, or in some way
reflect credit on him. He said once: ‘As a healthy body
resists the influence of a storm, so a state can brave dangers
when the citizens are of one mind.’ When Filippo Valori
(brother of his biographer) was desirous but yet afraid to
try to reconcile Lorenzo with Antonio Tebalducci, against
whom the latter had grounds for complaint, Lorenzo said to
him: ‘To recommend a friend to me would be no merit, but
for making an opponent my friend I thank thee, and I beg
thee to do it again in the like case.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Only he who knows
how to forgive knows how to conquer,’ he added.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The
combination of prince and citizen, statesman and man of
letters; the mixture of gravity and gaiety, of lofty intellect
and cheerful participation in everyday life, of grandeur and
simplicity in his household and family, of sagacious calculation
and hearty unfeigned good nature,&mdash;all this makes
Lorenzo de’ Medici an unusual figure, very attractive in its
individuality, and accounts for the impression he made on
all; especially, and most lastingly, on those who were intimate
at his house and had the opportunity of observing
him in private.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CARDINALATE OF GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Both</span> contemporary and later writers have passed an unfavourable
judgment on Pope Innocent VIII. ‘Though the
life of Innocent VIII. was useless for the general good,’
remarks Guicciardini at the beginning of his great history,
‘at least it was useful thus far, in that, frightened at his
unsuccessful attempt to meddle in the Barons’ War, during
the remainder of his pontificate he directed his attention to
trifles instead of planning for himself and his belongings
things which might have disturbed the peace of Italy.’
This negative praise is not without truth, but it gives little
insight into the character and aims of the Pope. His
greatest faults were weakness and inconsistency: hence the
sorry part which he played as a ruler, although he had no
tendency towards nepotism and was gifted with sound judgment.
It was his weakness which made him abandon the
affairs of Aquila and of the Barons, and caused his ever-wavering
conduct towards the King of Naples. The latter
alternately lured and contemptuously defied him, rendered
the treatment of his own restless feudatories uncertain,
and provoked disturbances in Rome which led to the robbing
of the papal treasury by the Pope’s own son. Yet that son,
compared with the nephews of the last Pope&mdash;not to mention
the one who followed&mdash;was but very modestly provided
for; so barely indeed that, but for the resources of the Medici,
Franceschetto Cybò, at the Pope’s death, would have been,
for one in his position, a poor man. It was long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Innocent made up his mind to do anything serious for him;
and considering the traditions of all the Papal ‘nephews,’
the Colonna, Piccolomini, Della Rovere, and Riari, it may
be well imagined that Franceschetto became impatient;
more so, perhaps, as the Pope’s health was failing owing to
the two apoplectic attacks he had had in January 1485, and
in February of the following year, during which he had
been given up for dead. ‘These occurrences,’ remarks his
biographer,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> ‘made his family anxious to secure their position
for the future, and they begged the Pope to make provision
for this while it was yet time.’</p>

<p>But they gained little, and not till after Franceschetto’s
marriage did his circumstances begin really to improve.
Lorenzo was not behindhand with his persuasions: ‘It is
not without a blush,’ he wrote on February 26, 1488,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> ‘that
I commend to your Holiness the affairs of Signor Francesco;
for it seems to me unreasonable to commend to your Holiness
that which for natural reasons must be nearer your
heart than anything else. My letters and intercession cannot
in reason have more weight than the natural relationship
between your Holiness and Signor Francesco; but as I see
that his affairs proceed very slowly, I feel I ought not to
refuse him my recommendation and every other support.
As he is, he tells me, very happy in possessing Maddalena,
this should be to your Holiness an occasion for treating him
so as to please me too. This will be the case if his position
becomes such as shall befit the dignity of your Holiness and
set my mind at rest. I never had any idea that your Holiness
should take anything from others, or give offence to
any, in order to make him great. As this would be dishonourable
and contrary to the nature of your Holiness, so,
on the other hand, I think that it would not be in accordance
with your natural kindness and goodness if your Holiness
did not provide for him, as he can easily be portioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
in a manner befitting his rank without any injury to others.
I humbly beg your Holiness to relieve yourself as well as me
of this trouble, and establish him so that further importunity
shall be needless. Thus your Holiness will be doing a work
worthy of your goodness, not only sensible and pious, but
necessary, and greatly desired by me, as a good example for
all those who set their hopes on your Holiness.’</p>

<p>Still the Pope was far too slow for Franceschetto’s impatience,
and seems to have had no great opinion of the
latter’s judgment. The son-in-law’s letters to his father-in-law
are full of complaints which really display Innocent in a
more honourable light than those by whom he was thus
beset. ‘Like the ox, he needs the goad.’ This was a son
writing of his father, and that father the Pope! Lorenzo
was not much behind his son-in-law. One of his letters to
the Pope<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> is but too glaring an example of the profane tone
in which this man, who could display such a refined sense of
decorum in other things, addressed with the utmost coolness
the very head of the Church. Innocent had had another of
his attacks of illness, and Lorenzo was getting anxious:
‘As St. Francis, by means of the stigmata, experienced in
his own body the Passion of Christ, so do I feel in and about
myself all the sufferings of your Holiness; for, putting aside
other reasons, I have the situation of our dear Signor Francesco
and of many servants of your Holiness very much at
heart. Owing to your Holiness’ conscientious holding back,
all these remain almost empty-handed and have no part of
the fortune and favour which God has given your Holiness
for your merits; so that, should your Holiness be called
away, which God forbid, they would sink likewise into the
grave. More especially, however, am I moved, as must be
the case with your Holiness also, by the position of poor
Signor Francesco, who, after five years of your pontificate,
is only just beginning to have something he can call his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Your Holiness knows better than I what supporters he has
in the Sacred College. The history of the Popes shows how
few have reigned much beyond five years, and how many
have not waited so long before showing themselves as Popes,
without giving way to such scruples and forbearance, justifiable
no doubt before God and man, but which, if they last
long, may be misconstrued. Perhaps I seem too bold; but
zeal and conscience impose upon me the duty of speaking
freely and reminding you that men are not immortal, that a
Pope is what he chooses to be, that he cannot leave his
pontificate to his heirs, and can call nothing his own but
honour and glory and what he does for his relatives. Instead
of depending on health and luck, your Holiness should not
put off doing what you project, and for which later there
might perhaps be no opportunity. Above all I commend to
you your and my dear Signor Francesco and Maddalena,
who pray God to grant your Holiness a long life that you
may set their affairs in order. It is now about time to
release these holy fathers from Limbo, that their fate may
not be like that of the Jews waiting for the Messiah.’</p>

<p>While the Pope was thus plagued about secular matters,
it was much the same with ecclesiastical ones. In both
cases the object was one and the same&mdash;increase of riches
and power. Everything was regarded and treated from this
point of view; of anything beyond, politicians&mdash;even highly-gifted
ones like Lorenzo&mdash;had no conception. Lorenzo was
impatient to get property for Franceschetto Cybò, he was
still more impatient to get the red hat for his own son.
Giovanni was born on December 11, 1475, and was consequently
in his ninth year when Innocent became Pope.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
Some preparations had been made even then: ‘Cousin,’
wrote Louis XI. from Plessis-les-Tours on February 3, 1483,
in reply to Lorenzo who had applied to him on the death of
Cardinal d’Estouteville, ‘I have seen what you wrote to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
concerning the benefices of the Cardinal of Rouen, and much
regret not to have known thereof sooner; for I should be
very pleased if your son should obtain a good provision and
benefice in my kingdom.’</p>

<p>The king was as good as his word; that same spring
he conferred on the child not only the abbacy of Font
Doulce in the diocese of Saintes, but also the archbishopric
of Aix, which was supposed to be vacant. ‘On May 19, 1483,’
says Lorenzo in his memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> ‘news came that the King of
France, of his own free will, had conferred the abbacy of
Font Doulce on our Giovanni; and on the 31st we heard
from Rome that the Pope (Sixtus IV.) had confirmed the
appointment, declared him capable of holding benefices at
the age of seven, and appointed him a protonotary.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> On June 1,
Giovanni, accompanied by me, came from Poggio (a Cajano)
to Florence, whereupon he was confirmed and tonsured by
the Lord Bishop of Arezzo, and was thenceforth called
Messer Giovanni. The aforesaid ceremonies took place in
our private chapel, and in the evening we returned to Poggio.
On the morning of June 8, Jacopino the courier came with
a letter from the French king, whereof the contents were that
he had conferred on our Messer Giovanni the archbishopric of
Aix in Provence. In the evening he went on to Rome with
letters from the king to the Pope and the Cardinal of Maçon
(Philibert Hugonet), and at the same time a courier was
sent to Forlì with a letter for Count Girolamo. On the 11th
the courier came back from Forlì with letters from the count
for the Pope and San Giorgio (Cardinal Riario), which were
forwarded to Rome by the Milanese post. May God direct
all for good. On the same day, after mass, all the children,
except Messer Giovanni, were confirmed in the chapel. On
the 15th, about the sixth hour of the evening, intelligence
came from Rome that the Pope raised difficulties about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
appointment to the archbishopric on account of Messer
Giovanni’s youth; of which news the king was at once informed
by the same messenger. On the 20th came from
Lionetto (de’ Rossi) the announcement that the archbishop
was still alive! On March 1, 1484 (1485), the Abbot of
Passignano died, and an express was sent to Messer Giovan
Antonio Vespucci, envoy at Rome, to beg the abbey from
the Pope (Innocent VIII.) for our Messer Giovanni. On
the 2nd, in pursuance of an ordinance of the Signoria, possession
was taken of it, in virtue of the reservation made in
Messer Giovanni’s favour by Pope Sixtus and confirmed by
Pope Innocent when our Piero went to Rome to do him
homage.’ These details show but too plainly how benefices
were dealt with, and how at the mere rumour of a prelate’s
death temporal sovereigns disposed of a high spiritual office
in favour of a child. A few years after this, King Matthias
Corvinus conferred on a boy of seven&mdash;his nephew Ippolito
of Este&mdash;the primatial see of Hungary, the archbishopric of
Gran. Like Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII. at first refused to
confirm the appointment, but he ended by yielding.</p>

<p>The abbey of Passignano, belonging to the monks of
Vallombrosa, was one of the richest in Tuscany. The young
abbot continued to enjoy its possession till 1499, when he
gave it up to the General of the Order for a pension of 2,000
scudi. The grand fortress-like building, which remained in
the possession of the Order down to our own day, stands in the
valley of the Pesa, sixteen miles south of Florence, on the
left of the Roman military road; its church is adorned with
paintings by Domenico Cresti, who was somewhat of the
Caracci school, and was called by the name of his birthplace,
Passignano. Everything in the shape of benefices of all
kinds, commanderies, rectorships, and so forth, that came
within reach of the Medici, fell to Lorenzo’s son; in 1486
he actually obtained, as a commandery, the abbey of Monte
Cassino; King Ferrante having, in order to conciliate the
Pope, given him free disposal of the famous convent of S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Benedict.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> How anxious the king was to appease the
Medicean hunger after benefices is shown by his letter of
August 23, 1486, in answer to Lorenzo’s thanks.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> ‘Thanks
from you were needless, for God knows we are ready and
willing to do anything in the world to prove to you our gratitude
for what you have continually done for our good and
that of our state, on which you may reckon as on your own
property. Our obligations to you demand this; and we can
never do enough in favour of you and your house to satisfy
the thousandth part of our desire, as we hope you will perceive
more clearly every day.’ Lodovico il Moro answered
in the same strain when Lorenzo thanked him for giving his
son the abbacy of Miramondo.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>All this, however, was but the prelude. There is something
very repulsive in the impatience with which Lorenzo
looked forward to his son’s cardinalate, and pressed the Pope
to confer it. For the ambassadors of the Republic there
seemed to be nothing more important than this. Lorenzo
always took special good care that men who were in his own
deepest confidence should be sent to the Popes. In the
spring of 1487 Innocent wished that Pier Filippo Pandolfini,
who had formerly been in Rome, should be appointed to the
vacant post of ambassador; but he could not leave Florence,
and the place was taken by Giovanni Lanfredini, whose
capabilities had lately been tested at Naples. ‘I have used
my influence with the Signoria,’ wrote Lorenzo to the Pope
on May 6,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> ‘to procure the appointment of a man with whom
your Holiness will be perfectly satisfied. For besides that
Giovanni Lanfredini (he who is destined for Rome) is an excellent
honest man and conversant with business, he also
possesses my heart (<i>il core mio</i>), as I am much attached to
him on account of his merits.’ To Lanfredini himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Lorenzo wrote on June 16 of the following year:<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> ‘I have
heard what his Holiness said to you about the creation of
cardinals. I think the Pope should not put off the nomination
any longer than is absolutely necessary. According to
my view his Holiness will be quite another Pope after it.
For whereas hitherto he has been a head without members,
he must get some; whereas he has been the creature of
others, now others must be the creatures of him. Therefore
persuade him, yea, urge him, to take the needful decision;
the sooner the better. <i>Periculum est in mora</i>; as much as
he gains by acting he loses by hesitating. Use all your influence
to procure this blessed promotion as soon as possible.
As the matter is before the Sacred College, it cannot be delayed
without great damage to the holy father’s dignity and
power. As to the persons to be nominated, I approve of all
the names which are marked; they are those of which you
have spoken to me. If he can do us that pleasure, let him
do it. If the promotion were to be put off on our account,
tell him he may act according to his judgment. If he
thinks it well to begin with a single one to show that it is
in his power, he can nominate more by degrees till everybody
is satisfied.’</p>

<p>Months passed away; the Pope’s indecision was unconquerable,
and Lorenzo’s impatience increased. ‘As I understand
from our ambassador,’ he wrote to Innocent on October
1, 1488,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> ‘that your Holiness intends shortly to create
some cardinals, I should think myself deserving of grave
censure did I not put you in mind of the honour of this city
and my own, though I am sure that your Holiness in your
goodness remembers both. I do not believe that in the
whole course of your pontificate you could do anything that
would deserve more gratitude from the city; and as the
dignity of a cardinal is lofty and much sought after, this
city would feel it deeply should her hopes not be fulfilled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>’
It concerned the honour of Florence that a son of Lorenzo&mdash;a
mere boy&mdash;should be received into the senate of the Church!
Meantime, while Lorenzo thus unceasingly urged his claim,
he was taking equal trouble to prevent the same dignity from
being conferred on some fellow-countryman for whom he
had no predilection. ‘The Pope,’ he wrote to the ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
‘does not know our people’s ways (<i>i polli nostri</i>) as we do.
Not only the cardinalate, but any increase of position and
dignity, would be dangerous if it came otherwise than in the
right way.’ Who can tell whether the chief cause of this
long delay in the only promotion undertaken by this Pope
was not really a scruple, struggling with political considerations?
Innocent himself had decided that no one under
thirty should be admitted to the cardinalate, and Giovanni
de’ Medici was not yet fourteen. Lorenzo never ceased
writing,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Lanfredini never ceased talking. Cardinals Sforza,
Borgia, La Balue, and Zeno, were pressed into the service.
‘The services daily rendered us by Monsignor Ascanio,’ says
Lorenzo in a letter to the ambassador, February 21, 1489,
‘deserve better thanks than words. My obligations to him
could not be greater if I were recalled from death to life.’
The story current in Florence&mdash;perhaps exaggerated&mdash;of the
sums spent on the occasion furnishes a commentary on these
words.</p>

<p>At last, on March 9, 1489, the promotion took place.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
It resulted in five cardinals, among whom were the Pope’s
relative Lorenzo de’ Mari, who took the name of Cybò, and
the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John, the heroic
defender of Rhodes, Pierre d’Aubusson. But besides these
five, at the same consistory, Innocent conferred the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
dignity on three others, without publishing their names&mdash;what
is now called a reservation <i>in petto</i>. One of these was
Maffeo Gherardi, a Camaldulensian, patriarch of Venice;
the second was Federigo Sanseverino, son of Roberto; the
third was Giovanni de’ Medici.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that the Pope was ashamed of himself.
In the worst days of the Church no child had yet been made
a cardinal. The nomination was to be kept secret for three
years; whosoever divulged it was to be excommunicated.
It was very soon seen how this was observed. On the day
of the promotion, cardinals Sforza and La Balue, the Bishop
of Cortona, prefect of the Apostolic Chamber, and the ambassador,
announced to Lorenzo that his son had been made
cardinal-deacon of Sta. Maria in Domenica.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> ‘God be
thanked,’ wrote Lorenzo to the last-mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> ‘for the
good news received yesterday about Messer Giovanni; news
which gave me all the greater pleasure, because I expected
it the less on account of the importance of the matter and
its difficulty bordering on impossibility, besides which it far
exceeds my deserts.... I know not whether the Pope is displeased
at the rejoicings which have taken place here on all
sides, and in such a degree as I never saw before; there would
have been a yet more brilliant expression of general joy, had I
not interfered. To prevent the demonstration was out of my
power. As Messer Giovanni’s promotion is secret, these festivities
certainly seem out of place. But you at Rome have let the
thing become so well known that it could not be otherwise
here; and it would have been impossible for me to keep aloof
from the congratulations of whole cities, small and great.
If it is wrong, it cannot be helped. Now I want to know
how we are to behave ourselves in future, and how Messer
Giovanni’s mode of life, dress, and servants are to be arranged;
for I would not reward so great a benefit by not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
making a proper display according to the manner most
likely to please the Pope. Messer Giovanni keeps at home;
the house is full of people. (The foreign ambassadors had
immediately come to offer their congratulations.) I wait to
hear from you whether I shall, as I proposed to you, send
Piero to Rome. Perhaps it would be more befitting the importance
of the favour that I should go there myself.’ Poliziano
had written a letter to the Pope, taking occasion of
the nomination to praise Innocent and describe the lad as
worthy of his new distinction. He wanted to have it read
out in the Consistory; but Lorenzo had too much tact to
join in such an absurdity, and sent the letter to the ambassador,
not concealing his own adverse opinion, and leaving
it to Lanfredini to do with it what he thought fit.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, March 4, Lorenzo addressed to the
Pope the following letter of thanks.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> ‘I have received with
the utmost reverence your Holiness’s brief of the 9th instant,
concerning the promotion of Messer Giovanni. As this news
had already reached me through our ambassador, I at once
wrote to your Holiness, more to put into words my inability
to thank you fittingly, than to give expression to my gratitude.
That God alone can do, not I. This only can I say
in reference to this undying benefit, that through what your
Holiness has done for my son you have at the same time
elevated me; and this increase of authority, as well as whatever
more may accrue to me, I place at the disposal of your
Holiness, to whom it belongs rather than to me.’ Then
comes an apology for the publication of the news, which had
originated not with Lorenzo but in Rome. The Italian princes
by no means undervalued this new proof of Lorenzo’s influence
over the Pope. The Duke of Calabria said to Vettori, the
ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> that one could see how great was Lorenzo’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
power, and that the Florentine ambassador ruled Innocent.
He wished he could be together with Lorenzo and Sforza to
talk over the strife with Rome. He believed it would not
be difficult for him to make the alliance of the three states
such as should be apparent in their whole conduct. One
could see how much the Pope did for Lorenzo, and how he
had made his son a cardinal at an unheard-of age; so that
one might conclude that everything could be arranged if he
chose to do all he could.</p>

<p>The man who had contributed most to overcome the
Pope’s scruples, Giovanni Lanfredini, only survived his
success a few months. In November 1488, he had lost at
Rome his eldest son, Orsino, a youth of sixteen.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> ‘It is with
much regret,’ wrote Lorenzo,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> ‘that I have heard of your
son’s death; the news was the more painful to me as I had
not known of his illness. If I did not know your strength
of mind, and how accustomed you are to both good and evil,
I should use more words of consolation than I do, and represent
to you my own heavy losses, which are but too well
known to you. Resign yourself to the decree of God; the
more so as your son is far rather to be envied than pitied.
You and yours will never want for friends who regard your
concerns as their own. As for me, on account of the sympathy
I feel for you and for the sake of your old and tried
attachment, I shall always conduct myself towards you as
your sentiments and actions, and my duty and gratitude,
require. Be comforted, Giovanni; take courage, trust in
God, and reckon on your friends.’ Another letter<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> is expressed
in equally cordial terms. But the loss of the son
broke the father’s heart. ‘Giovanni Lanfredini,’ wrote the
Ferrarese ambassador on March 16, 1489,<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> ‘is at Rome confined
to his bed; and as business presses, the Signoria has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
ordered Pier Filippo Pandolfini, who is now at Pitigliano, to
proceed thither immediately. Lanfredini has asked for leave
of absence. He seems to have had quite enough of his post,
and I think he feels he can now give it up with honour,
after helping the son of the illustrious Lorenzo to attain the
dignity of cardinal.’ As soon as the promotion took place,
Lorenzo had expressed his strong sense of what he owed to
Lanfredini.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> ‘I recognise the duty of always remembering
him who has directed the whole affair, and of putting those
who shall come after me in mind of it. For no greater event
has ever befallen our house, and I owe more than three
quarters of it to your zeal and attachment.’ Lanfredini’s
condition improved so that he could resume his duties; but
this did not last. He died on January 5, 1490, in the house
of the Acciaiuoli in the Leonine city.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop of Rimini wrote to Lorenzo:<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> ‘The man is
dead who kept this court at your service. Henceforth
things may take another turn; and they have already gone
so far that it has been said you will no longer have everything
your own way.’ It seems, indeed, that the weak-minded
Pope had allowed some suspicious remarks to escape
him, to the effect that he could not safely trust to Florence,
where individual interests were in the ascendant. These
expressions induced Lorenzo to send Bernardo Dovizi to
Rome to consult with Pandolfini. The instructions drawn
up by Lorenzo<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> show his irritation at the changeableness of
the Pope. ‘Such as neither know me personally nor have
seen me put faith in my word; and now I am met with want
of confidence after all my trouble and exertions, and the experience
there has been of my sentiments.’ The ill-feeling,
however, seems to have soon passed away.</p>

<p>One of the last affairs in which Lanfredini had to act was
the canonisation of the Archbishop Antonine, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Emperor Frederic III. was also interested. Lorenzo proposed
that the Bishop of Arezzo and Volterra should undertake
the cause. Lanfredini’s successor Pandolfini continued
the negotiations; but it was not till 1523 that the reverence
of the Florentine people for this worthy and pious man received
the sanction of the Church from Pope Hadrian VI.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN INNOCENT VIII. AND
FERRANTE OF NAPLES.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">During</span> all this time the quarrel between the Pope and the
king was assuming serious dimensions. One could hardly
expect otherwise when the characters of the two men are
taken into consideration. The one combined a full conception
of lofty dignity with the consciousness of very little real
power, was very excitable, wanting in perseverance, and
continually going from one extreme to another; the other
was slily calculating, practised in all the arts of unprincipled
cunning, and disposed to undervalue his opponent when the
tide seemed to have turned in his own favour. When the
king thought he had rid himself of all enemies and suspicious
persons in his own country, he did not hesitate to disregard
the stipulations agreed upon in August 1486, and defy the
Pope. The dispute went on through 1488 even to the proclamation
of ecclesiastical censures. This was unpleasant
to Lorenzo for many reasons: ‘I fear,’ he wrote to Lanfredini,
September 3,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> ‘people will think it is meal out of my
tub, though you know that the Pope has acted not only
without me but against my advice. Not only is the king
ready and inclined to attempt aggression, but the Pope is
utterly unprepared; in fact, his affairs are in such disorder
that a most disastrous war may arise out of this.’ Lorenzo’s
son-in-law begged him to go to Rome in the autumn, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
refused, waiting to see whether the Pope and the king would
come to terms. In the spring of 1489 the Spanish court made
an effort at mediation through ambassadors in Rome. Ferrante’s
object seemed to be to increase the Pope’s anger by personal
attacks on him and his, so as to produce an immediate
rupture. This conduct can be explained only on one of two
suppositions: he either thought that he could treat his
adversary as he chose without danger to himself, or he was
determined to let things come to a pass which might, indeed,
easily bring him to the gates of Rome, but might also just
as easily call other nations to the rescue. All the misfortunes
that befell Ferrante’s family and dynasty in 1495
were provoked by his self-will of six years before. It was
no thanks to him nor to his son, who was worse than he,
nor to the Pope, that they were not overtaken then by the
misfortune of which both parties&mdash;the one in his ambitious,
tyrannical stubbornness, the other in his inconsiderate weakness&mdash;seemed
to have no foreboding. That it was avoided
for a time was chiefly owing to Lorenzo de’ Medici, a fact
the merit of which ought to cover many of his sins.</p>

<p>After the fruitless Spanish attempt at mediation, and
while Ferrante was doing all he could to stir up the King of
the Romans against the Pope, the latter resolved to act. On
June 27, 1489, Niccolò Orsini, Count of Pitigliano, arrived
in Rome. A dispute between this excellent soldier and the
Republic of Siena had, in the previous April, resulted in his
dismissal from the Florentine service; whereupon the Pope
offered him the post of Captain-General of the Church. As
the astrologers pronounced the constellations favourable, on
the very day of the count’s arrival the Pope presented him
with his insignia of office, tunic, hat, sword, and commander’s
staff, and blessed the two standards, while Orsini knelt before
him. On the following Sunday the new captain-general
made his triumphal entry into Rome from Monte Mario.
He was then forty-eight years of age, but can be best
imagined as he is represented on his monument in SS. Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
e Paolo at Venice, erected twenty years later, when he
had fallen a victim to his exertions during the war of the
League of Cambrai. He appears there as a fine-looking
stately horseman with waving plume and rich scarf; his
head is slightly bent as if in thought, and turned towards
the right; he holds in his hand the commander’s staff, and
stands between allegorical statues of Prudence and Faith.
On the 30th, after high mass, the citation of the King of
Naples took place. He was allowed three months’ grace to
fulfil his duty as a vassal; that he would submit was not to
be expected. The most zealous preparations were made for
the war which seemed inevitable. Cardinal Sforza, on
behalf of Lodovico, and Lanfredini, who was ill, sought to
restrain the Pope from taking an extreme step. On the
part of the Florentines, at least, this mediation was honestly
meant.</p>

<p>Lorenzo went in July to the baths, whence, according
to the new Ferrarese ambassador Manfredo Manfredi,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
he came back refreshed and well on August 6. Scarcely was
he home when he set to work at the Roman affair. ‘As to
the deliberations yonder,’ he wrote on the 8th to Lanfredini,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
‘I am of opinion that in considering my Lord Lodovico’s
proposals you must always keep in view that he can be a
turncoat on occasion and may very likely have private aims,
as the quarrel between the Pope and the king may be very
convenient to him in many respects. Considering his nature,
therefore, we must not rely on him too much, but must
follow his example in profiting by his proceedings when they
answer our purposes, but keeping the upper hand if he takes
it into his head to change. First of all I wish the Holy
Father to let the Venetians know that both Lord Lodovico
and ourselves have induced him to conceal from the Republic
nothing that concerns his relations with the king. This I
say because in any case it seems to me important that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Pope should at least keep the Venetians in their present
mind until we all see our way clearer. There is no real
trust to be placed in those people, but their authority is
useful; and it is quite possible to keep on tolerable terms
with them without causing my Lord Lodovico to take fright.
But above all I wish to be assured whether the Pope is determined
to abide by the conditions already settled, or
whether he thinks of agreeing to some modifications. As to
the tribute-money, I think a compromise possible; as for the
barons, I see no means, as the king has gone too far to be
able to draw back. With regard to spiritual matters an
arrangement will be easy, for the king will hardly raise
difficulties where he has only to give promises. When it
comes to keeping them they must just wink at each other,
as all popes and all kings have done. The point therefore
is to know exactly what we have to abide by before taking a
decision which, according to my view, must depend on what
the Pope really intends; and his will cannot be forced, particularly
if peace is established in France. Endeavour therefore
to give me sure information if possible. In any case it
is my fixed opinion that the Pope’s honour must be kept
unstained, if my Lord Lodovico agrees with me, who, however,
as before said, is not much to be trusted. A good
understanding must be maintained with the Venetians, for
the sake of having something to fall back upon. I think
you must decline with thanks his Holiness’ proposal to confide
the negotiations in question to me. It would be a distinction
for me, but would scarcely answer his Holiness’
purposes. I, however, prefer his Holiness’ advantage to
that which would be an honour to me personally. In any
future agreement with the king, the conditions of the last
peace will have to be modified in some particulars, and
stronger shoulders than mine will be needed to bear that
burthen. I shall consider myself honoured enough if the
interests of his Holiness are secured with honour.’ Lorenzo’s
unwillingness to take part in negotiations between the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and Venice was partly founded on the knowledge that the
latter power was anything but well-disposed towards him. Two
years after this his friend Guidoni, the Ferrarese ambassador,
who had exchanged his post at Florence for the more difficult
one in the city of the lagoons, wrote to him: ‘The
Venetians detest your name more than Satan does the
Cross.’</p>

<p>As Ferrante showed no sign of returning from his ways,
Innocent continued to proceed against him. On September
11, 1489, in presence of the Neapolitan ambassador Antonio
d’Alessandri, the kingdom of Naples was solemnly declared
to have lapsed to the Holy See through non-fulfilment of
homage.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The ambassador protested and appealed to the
Council. The next day he appeared in the Sixtine Chapel
with the other ambassadors, to celebrate the anniversary of
the Pope’s coronation, just as if nothing had happened.
But he was startled on the 13th, when a French envoy,
Guillaume de Poitiers, of the family of the Counts of
St. Vallier, arrived with great pomp at the Vatican.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> For a
long time past the Pope had been negotiating with France,
and the French showed their desire for a good understanding
with Rome by delivering up the Turkish Prince Dschem
to Innocent at the end of the winter. It was already suspected
that as soon as affairs were settled in Brittany, where
resistance was already broken, whose last duke was dead,
and where union with the crown was in progress, the French
king, now nineteen, would turn his eyes towards Italy.
Rome, conscious of her own weakness, reckoned on foreign
aid, thinking she had two strings to her bow&mdash;France and
Spain&mdash;both of whom were supposed to be displeased with
Ferrante. But the prospect of war in Italy and interference
from abroad, no matter whence it came or what the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
might be, was highly displeasing to Lorenzo, and he renewed
his efforts to change the mind of the Pope.</p>

<p>‘From your despatch of October 13,’ thus he begins a
letter to Lanfredini four days later,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> ‘I perceive that his
Holiness has taken some little offence at my remonstrances
against proceeding with the citations. Any offence to the
Holy Father grieves me; but it would grieve me very much
if he thought my counsel and actions were determined by
anything but zeal for his good. I repeat, the Pope must
make up his mind about three things. Either he must get
justice from the king by force; or he must make as good
terms as he can with him; or, lastly, if this cannot be done
with honour, he must temporise and wait for more favourable
circumstances. The first would be the most honourable
plan; but I consider it dangerous and expensive, and think
it cannot be executed without calling in a foreign power to
Naples. Thereto three things are needful: first, the consent
of Venice and Milan; secondly, sufficient independent means,
both in men and money, on the part of the said power; and
thirdly, very great expenditure on the part of the Pope. For
the point is to over-match the king, whom Milan may perhaps
assist should Venice declare against him; so that Milan, too,
must be kept in check. An understanding with the barons
and those of similar rank would be useful in such a case. Now
I may be mistaken, but I cannot see the possibility of realising
all these presuppositions, and therefore I have dissuaded his
Holiness. Of the foreign powers only Spain and France can
be taken into consideration. Spain seems to me at this moment
incapable of either acting or paying,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> and how France is to
be relied upon I do not see. Supposing, however, that she
changed her nature, I would agree with his Holiness, provided
that in an expedition against Naples the person to be
benefited should be the Duke of Lorraine (as heir of Anjou),
which would be the least dangerous thing; for the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Lorraine is not King of France, and his relationship to the
royal house is of no great importance. Naples and Spain
are much nearer relatives, and yet not friends; and when a
man is once King of Naples he will go his own way.</p>

<p>‘All these reasons, it seems to me, ought to dissuade the
Pope from any undertaking of the kind. In such circumstances
it is of no use exasperating the king by citations
and suchlike. Nay, even if one was armed and ready, I
should still think it advisable to let such challenges alone,
in order to avoid the danger of the king’s proceeding from
words to deeds&mdash;a danger not to be under-rated. Better arm
in silence than excite others to the attack by expressing
hostility. As for the second case, that of an accommodation,
I am perhaps, speaking without an exact knowledge of
the state of affairs; and possibly conditions are being fixed
in consequence of which the citation may be an useful measure.
But from what I know, I believe that such a proceeding,
instead of facilitating an accommodation, only serves to
irritate, and will lead to a rupture. As for temporising, I
will say nothing, because an immediate agreement on the
most honourable terms possible seems to me far more to the
purpose than waiting for some favourable conjuncture; the
more so that, as you know better than I, the king has plenty
of means of doing harm. I can say no more at present, not
being sufficiently conversant with the details. If the Pope’s
fearlessness rests on any secure ground, take care to let me
know it, that I may be relieved from this anxiety. For
though I am not exactly faint-hearted, yet, from the confidence
placed in me by the Pope, his affairs cause me more
anxiety than my own. So long as I know of no better foundation
for his security, I cannot possibly be easy. On the
subject of my lord Lodovico and his nature, I have spoken
my mind freely. I am conscious that I am walking uprightly,
and have only the Pope’s interest in view. So I
repeat what I have said often before: I think an honourable
accommodation better than a successful war. If that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
is impossible, he must temporise, provided the supposed possible
favourable conditions do not exist. But if this should
be the case, the king too would show himself more yielding,
for he knows very well where he can be touched.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s remonstrances were not entirely ineffectual.
Innocent, who had been informed that the Neapolitan exiles,
especially the Sanseverini, had been well received at the
French court, and that the young king had promised to
restore them to their homes, went cautiously to work at
least with regard to foreign allies. Without making any
engagements, he tried to keep on good terms with France
and Spain. Remonstrances were also made on the part of
France, through special ambassadors, to King Ferrante;
but he never ceased defending at foreign courts what he
called the justice of his cause, and calculating that the
French had their hands full, he showed no disposition to
yield. Letters from the Duke of Saxony, King Maximilian,
and the Emperor, produced just as little effect.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The Duke
of Calabria told the Florentine ambassador that his father
would accede to reasonable demands from the Pope, but not
to things that were against his honour. He would send the
palfrey as a token of the feudal relation; but not one soldo
of tribute would he pay, and not one guilty baron would he
pardon.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> So the matter dragged on. In May 1490, Florence
was visited by a Neapolitan ambassador on his way to Milan,
Messer Camillo Seruciati.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The king instructed him to inform
the Signoria and Lorenzo that he had hitherto endured
many wrongs and insults from the Pope. If, however, the
latter persisted in his wrongful obstinacy and hostility and
did not leave off his threats of citation and excommunication,
his majesty was not minded to endure such offences
any longer. Without wasting any more words, the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
meant to appear in Rome, with lance in rest, and answer the
Pope in such a way as to make him see his error. The
Neapolitan ambassador, being refused admission to the
Pope’s chapel on Whitsun-eve, threatened to make his way
in by force. To avoid scandal it was arranged that none
of the diplomatic body should appear on that day.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> But the
affair seems to have been rather more seriously taken into
consideration by France than Ferrante expected. On June
8, the Pope said to Lanfredini’s successor<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> that if he were
not peaceable by nature and a good Italian, he held in his
hand the means of avenging himself on the king; for
months ago Madame de Beaujeu had caused a proposal to be
made to him for conferring Naples as a fief on the Duke of
Lorraine, in exchange for which the latter should cede his
claims to Provence and other territories to her husband, the
Duke of Bourbon,<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> the King of France in return assisting
him to obtain Naples. This proposal had recently been renewed;
he, the Pope, had said but little in reply, in order
not to draw down the French into Italy. He wished that
Lorenzo should be informed of the matter.</p>

<p>The situation was growing worse every day. There were
already some hostile dealings on the frontiers. Papal couriers,
carrying briefs that were never answered, were
searched and roughly treated; people sent by the Pope to
Benevento, and inhabitants of Pontecorvo going to Montecassino
to perform their devotions, were seized.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Innocent
complained that the indulgence he had shown towards the
king on account of the representations of the other Italian
powers had only made the former more insolent; and the
powers stood and looked on while he was being insulted. If
the Italians cared so little about his honour, he must turn
to foreigners. Pandolfini adds that he had never seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Pope so excited. The ambassador did what he could to
soothe him, representing to him that the moderation shown
towards the king had benefited his cause, and that he could
depend on the support of Florence, Milan, and Venice. The
Pope cut him short. He was always put off with fine
speeches. Real support was to be expected from Florence
alone. On account of Sforza’s changeableness, Milan was
not to be reckoned on; and Venice never proceeded to
action. He was determined to make an end of it. He
would excommunicate the king, declare him guilty of heresy,
and lay the kingdom under interdict. He had a perfect
right to do so. He would give notice of everything to the
allied States. If the king, in pursuance of his threat, made
war upon him, and no assistance was afforded him, he would
go abroad, where he would be received with open arms and
helped to get back his own again, to the shame and loss of
others. He could not remain in Italy otherwise than with
the dignity befitting a Pope; if they all left him in the
lurch, resistance to the king was impossible, on account of
the Church’s want of military power and the untrustworthiness
of the barons, who would only rejoice at his embarrassment.
He considered himself fully justified in going abroad
if the honour of the Holy See could not be saved otherwise.
Other popes had done it, and had come back with honour
and glory.</p>

<p>‘I saw,’ says Pandolfini, ‘that he had thoroughly considered
the matter, and was not talking merely to get something
out of me, as he could have no doubt of our attachment
and fidelity. I pointed out to him that he should
deliberate well, and not take a resolution which might bring
discredit upon him, perhaps without serving his purpose.
Foreign lands were full of strife, and the relations of Church
and State were all very different from what they had been
in the times of Innocent IV. and other popes, who had
sought refuge beyond the mountains.’ But the Pope was
not to be persuaded. He announced that he should summon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the ambassadors of all the powers, declare his resolve and
the grounds which compelled him to it, and proceed against
the king. The Neapolitan ambassador was sent away. The
Pope said also to Pandolfini: ‘If I go with the court to
France, of all the Italian powers you will get the most
advantage thereby, not only for your trade, but because I
shall have all possible regard to you, and shall consult
over everything with Lorenzo. Tell him these my words.’</p>

<p>It might have been thought that a conclusion was imminent.
But after the lapse of a year matters were at
exactly the same point. At the feast of SS. Peter and Paul,
1491, the king’s ambassador again presented the palfrey by
way of tribute, was again sent away, and again protested.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
Shortly after, the Florentine ambassador at Naples, Piero
Nasi, had an interview with Giovanni Pontano, who was at
that time Ferrante’s chief counsellor in political affairs, and
had concluded the treaty with Rome in August 1486.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
Pontano certainly must have felt that he was personally
concerned, especially if, as is said, Innocent, having during
his negotiations with him been warned of the king’s faithlessness,
answered, ‘How can I be distrustful in dealing with
a man who has never broken his word?’ ‘Ambassador,’
said Pontano to Nasi, ‘I most earnestly desire the termination
of this strife, both for the sake of your Signoria and for
my own sake. If the matter worries you in Florence, it
worries me twice as much. Blame is laid on me which I do
not deserve. What I promised in those days at Rome I
had a right to promise; and it would have been kept; but
no sooner was I away (would to God I had not gone in such
a hurry!) than Cardinal della Rovere arrived from Genoa,
and thereupon they re-arranged the conditions according to
their pleasure. I certainly promised payment of the tribute,
but the Pope himself gave me to understand that he would
not insist upon it, and said: “I will come to an understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
with the king on that point.” But Ascanio (Sforza) and
the other cardinals laughed and said I might promise off-hand,
nothing would be kept.’ Pontano then went on to the
affair of the barons, whose misfortunes he attributed to their
own want of head. The king, he said, had not thought of
taking them prisoners, after he had made them harmless by
occupying their strongholds, and taken into his own hands
the administration of justice within their territories. But
they themselves had compelled him to proceed against them.
For after the Prince of Salerno had gone to Rome and deluded
the Pope with many things, he drew the barons into the plot,
all of which became known to the king. Notwithstanding,
the latter gave them plenty of time to place themselves in
safety; but they were determined to wait for the end, and
so it went ill with them at the last. The very man from
whom proceeded this apology for the king, afterwards himself
accused Ferrante and Alfonso of cruelty and covetousness!<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
Nasi thought the Pope cared far more about this
affair than for the money question. King Alfonso had once
paid 30,000 ducats to Pope Pius II. It was indeed maintained
that this was not tribute-money; but yet such another
sum would surely be granted. For the investiture to be extended
to the Duke of Calabria they would be willing to pay
50,000. The Pope could then confirm the bull of Sixtus IV.
and content himself during the rest of his pontificate with
the gaily adorned palfrey. Lorenzo should carefully consider
the matter.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1491 Pontano was sent to Rome to
arrange a compromise. The hint that Naples was willing
to pay seems to have had its effect. On reflection it is easy
to see in what financial difficulties Innocent had placed himself.
Lorenzo had to lend him money and redeem his pawned
valuables; as Lanfredini had said, he was applying to all the
sovereigns for tithes, and had made debts to the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
300,000 ducats.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> But further hindrances kept cropping up,
chiefly through the double-dealing of Ferrante, whom no
one dared trust even when he, perhaps, really did mean
honestly. It was said both at Rome and at Florence that
he was stirring up troubles for the Pope in the States of the
Church, and confirming the inhabitants of Ascoli in their
rebellion against the Holy See, for which purpose he kept a
numerous body of troops on the Tronto.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Lorenzo never
ceased advising a reconciliation. Many things were done
by the soldiers, he wrote to Innocent, which it was not
becoming a wise prince and thoughtful Pope to leave unhindered,
and the peace of all Italy would be in danger if an
end were not put to the quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> In the middle of November
the king expressed his sense of obligation to Lorenzo, who
was showing himself a true friend and mediator in these
differences. He hoped, he said, soon to arrive at a settlement.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
In the beginning of December they did arrive at one; and
two months later peace was announced in the Consistory.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
In the investiture to be given to the Duke of Calabria, for
which the sum before mentioned was to be paid, his son, the
Prince of Capua, was included. The new treaty was to be
the only one in force. To the barons released from prison
the king promised to pay a certain sum yearly. ‘How much,’
adds the Ferrarese ambassador, ‘is not known; and it is
supposed to have been agreed upon merely for the sake of
the Pope’s honour. Whether it will be kept, the future will
show.’ The future, and no very distant one, brought on the
Neapolitan king far other troubles than those caused by his
quarrel with the Pope. Scarcely was that quarrel ended,
scarcely was the settlement effected for which Pontano went
to Rome,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> when the king exhausted himself in demonstrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
of gratitude and friendship towards the Pope, to whose blessing
he attributed his own prosperity and that of all belonging
to him, to whom he sent hippocras and twenty-four casks
of choice Neapolitan wines, and with whom he formed a
connection by betrothing his grandson, the Marquis of Gerace,
to Battistina Usodimare, daughter of Teodorina Cybò.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Ferrante
must have felt that the time was pressing for a reconciliation.
French affairs gave him subjects for consideration.
Charles VIII. had not only&mdash;thanks to his sister&mdash;overcome
a dangerous opposition, but had reconciled the Duke of
Orleans to himself and his house, and won Britanny, whose
heiress gave him her hand on December 4, 1491. A double
Papal dispensation was needed; for Charles was betrothed
to Margaret of Austria, and Anne of Britanny already bore
the title of Queen of the Romans as the bride of Margaret’s
brother Maximilian; besides which the newly-married couple
were near relations. Doubtless with a view to what was
coming, a French embassy consisting of ten persons, headed
by Jean de Villiers et La Groslaye, Bishop of Lombes and
Abbot of St. Denis (afterwards highly influential at Rome),
had been sent to Rome and received there on November 16.
On December 3, a courier brought tidings of the marriage,
which gave great offence, but for which the dispensations
were given afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Another struggle with Maximilian
was inevitable. But France was united and peaceful within,
the last great fief was joined to the crown, and the work
begun by Louis XI. was accomplished. Italy had reason to
fear that the young king, whose ambition was greater than
his intellectual capacity, would again take up claims which
had never been really set at rest. In the very same year
which closed with the agreement between Innocent and
Ferrante the declaration of Charles VIII.’s rights to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
crown worn by the latter was formulated. Five years before,
the Duke of Orleans had put forward the claims to Milan
which he afterwards enforced as king.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>If it was to the interest of France to stand well with
the Pope, Ferrante had more than one motive for doing so.
His daughter Beatrice, the widow of Matthias Corvinus, was
threatened with dissolution of marriage by her second husband,
the Polish Prince Ladislas, to whose elevation to the throne
of Hungary she had greatly contributed; and it cost her
father much trouble and anxiety to avert a decision which
touched his own honour and that of his house. But the
king, now growing old, was occupied with another family
matter. The marriage of his granddaughter with the young
Duke of Milan was the immediate, if not the principal, cause
of a disagreement which sowed the seeds of ruin far beyond
palaces and dynasties. The ambassador, whose arrival at
Florence in the beginning of May 1490 has already been
mentioned, was to go to Milan ‘to find out in what relation
the lady duchess stood towards her most illustrious consort.’<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
The bad reports of Gian Galeazzo’s state of health proved
unfounded, and Isabella soon after had hopes of becoming a
mother. But matters remained unchanged. Gian Galeazzo
at one and twenty was duke only in name. The government
was still as it always had been, in the hands of his uncle,
who had filled up all state-offices and military commands
with confidants of his own. Connected with this last fact
was the circumstance that in June 1488, Gian Jacopo Trivulzio,
being apparently suspected by the Moro of taking Gian
Galeazzo’s part, left the Milanese service and accepted a
<i>condotta</i> offered him by King Ferrante.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>The case became worse when, in January 18, 1491,
Lodovico married. His bride, Beatrice of Este, was a near
relative of Isabella of Aragon, for her mother was the sister
of Isabella’s father; but the relations between the two young
wives soon became unbearable. Beatrice, the younger by
five years, handsome, clever, ambitious, and proud, soon
acquired great influence over her husband, now a man of
forty; she went hand-in-hand with him in all his far-reaching
plans, and induced him to yield to her desires with regard
to outward position more than the cunning reserved
man perhaps at first intended. She and Isabella soon came
to open strife. The Duchess of Milan very naturally claimed
the first place; the Duchess of Bari had no intention of contenting
herself with the second. Lodovico’s authority made
it easy for her to satisfy her passion for ruling. Isabella
bore with growing impatience daily insults to herself and
the unworthy position of her husband; of him too little is
known to furnish grounds for a decided judgment of his
character and capabilities. At last she appealed to her
father, representing to him her position and begging for his
intervention.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>There had been no love lost between Alfonso and Lodovico
ever since the Ferrara war. Although in the disputes between
the Pope and the king, the Sforza had not furthered the
views of France against Ferrante, still the Moro’s attitude
had been questionable. If the Duke of Calabria had had his
way, at the time when the treaty was concluded with the
Pope, Italy would have been in flames; for his counsel was
to cross the Tronto with an army and force Lodovico to lay
down his usurped power. But the old king was afraid of a
step which threatened to bring incalculable consequences;
particularly as the Moro’s intimate relations with France&mdash;relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
whose first fruits were the complete abandonment
in favour of Milan of the French claims to Genoa&mdash;and certain
events in Florence which will be mentioned presently, gave
him every motive for extreme caution. Instead of arms he
tried negotiation. A Neapolitan embassy was sent to Milan,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
but it had no answer but empty phrases. Lodovico replied
that his nephew was Duke and enjoyed all the privileges of
his rank. He himself had for years only borne the burthen
of affairs, which he would lay down as soon as circumstances
permitted. The only result of the application was that the
good understanding between the house of Naples and the
Sforza, already much endangered, notwithstanding the continued
ostensible alliance, received a very severe shock.
There was, indeed, no lack of friendly protestations on either
side; and on February 8, 1492,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> not long before the departure
of the embassy above-mentioned, Ferrante wrote to his
ambassador in Milan that he regarded the Duke of Bari as
his own son (it is true the latter married his granddaughter)
and his interests as his own, and congratulated him on his
good understanding with France. Lodovico, to secure the
maintenance of a power which he knew he was in danger of
losing sooner or later, used all the means supplied by his
versatile and inventive genius, and deluded himself with the
increasing consciousness of his superiority over all other
Italian rulers, only to involve himself irretrievably in the
machinations which brought to ruin the edifice of Italian
polity.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">OPPOSITION TENDENCIES. FRA GIROLAMO SAVONAROLA.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> Medici had always counted on the clergy for support.
It would be unjust to attribute this entirely to selfish
motives; they had other and nobler aims than merely that
of more easily ruling the multitude in union with its spiritual
directors. Other motives besides scruples of conscience
actuated them in the building of churches and convents.
The clergy, especially the regular clergy, were, with a portion
of the nobility, still the chief representatives of the
higher scientific and literary culture. Cosimo’s grandson as
well as himself found instruction, entertainment, and intellectual
animation in the society of Camaldulensians, Dominicans,
Augustinians, and Servites. But as Lorenzo endeavoured
to keep under his own control the bishoprics of the
district, he made use of the monastic orders in the same
way. He employed them privately to discover and direct
the stream of popular opinion and popular inclination.
Owing to their constitution, their varied composition, their
connection with all classes, and their comparative independence,
they were at once more trustworthy and abler instruments
than the lay communities of various kinds which he
ruled by means of his confidants, high and low. These
latter societies might prove dangerous to him through party-spirit
and secret machinations; a danger which indeed
afterwards became apparent, and was vigorously opposed by
the rulers of Tuscany. The religious orders, when they devoted
themselves to furthering the aims of the Medici, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
another advantage over the companies. The many little
jealousies and enmities which divided them from each other
gave better security for secresy; and the fact that very much
depended upon this may afford an explanation of the great
liberality of the Medici towards the convents. In the
annals of the Monastery of the Angeli, where Cosimo was
wont to visit Ambrogio Traversari, and where Lorenzo’s sons
went to hear philosophical lectures and to be present at
sacred representations, it is recorded that besides the usual
yearly gifts of money, Lorenzo used on certain festivals to
send to the monks, who were by no means rich, fish, cheese,
and fruit; and also that he procured for them the bounty of
the Signoria. ‘We owe everything to God, through Lorenzo
His instrument.’ Don Guido, formerly a Cistercian monk,
who became prior of the Angeli in 1484, was Lorenzo’s confessor.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>But it would be a mistake to suppose that even when his
relations with the Papacy were most intimate, Lorenzo could
reckon unconditionally upon the clergy. Those same disputes
between the religious orders came in the way, as well
as the democratic spirit prevalent among the monks, which
saw through the tendencies of the existing government even
when it seemed to be favouring popular objects. This internal
opposition naturally developed more strongly as a
more serious way of thinking gained ground; such a temper
as had been fostered by the pious chief pastors Antonine and
Orlando Bonarli, though their successors, under whom the
diocese of Florence was chiefly administered by vicars, did
nothing to maintain it. About the year 1490 it became apparent
that the general life of pleasure and worldliness was
about to take a turn in an opposite direction. No one could
then foresee the ultimate scope and results of this opposition;
but it showed itself in a manner which necessarily attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the attention of him who was accustomed to direct all
things, and who had too much tact and too much practice
in judging of moral and intellectual tendencies not to recognise
the first symptoms of a turn of the tide. Its importance
was the more apparent to him because it showed itself
in a field, of which, as of those of politics and literature, he
thought himself the ruler; but which was withdrawn from
his influence as soon as the prevalent materialistic tendencies
were combated by inward moral impulses and views. This
resistance was in the highest degree dangerous to the
Medici, because its chief strength lay in the moral consciousness
of the people, hitherto artificially suppressed or put to
sleep, but now awakened to new life; and it was this which
enabled it to hold out so firmly long after it appeared to be
conquered. It was the fate of the Medici that opposition
sprang from ground which they had long been accustomed
to regard as their own, and to treat in the light of an heirloom.</p>

<p>In 1482, there entered the convent of San Marco a
brother of the order, who had been driven from his native city
of Ferrara by the storms of war raging around it, in order to
seek a more peaceful sphere of activity beyond the Apennines,
little suspecting what other storms he would have to encounter
there. The Porta Savonarola at Padua recalls to
mind the neighbouring residence of that noble family; and
in the Prato della Valle stands a statue of Antonio Savonarola,
who manfully defended his native city in the middle of
the thirteenth century. In 1440 Michele Savonarola was
called to Ferrara, where he was presented with the rights of
citizenship by the Marquis Lionello d’Este, and acquired a
great reputation as physician in ordinary to the Marquis, as
professor at the university, and also as an author.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> His son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Niccolò married Elena Bonacossi, and her masculine spirit
was inherited by her son Girolamo, who has made the name
of his race famous throughout the world. At the age of
three-and-twenty this son, without consulting the wishes of
his parents, entered the Predicant order at Bologna in the
spring of 1475. In a letter to his father he pleaded, in explanation
and justification of the step, his soul’s cry of anguish
against the worldliness to which he beheld Italy fallen
a prey. ‘I could no longer look upon the deep corruption
of the blinded people, the oppression of virtue, the exaltation
of vice; it was an unspeakable torment to me, and I prayed
daily to God that He might take me out of this pit of destruction.
Now, in His infinite goodness, He has vouchsafed
this grace to me, notwithstanding my unworthiness.’
But it was not the worldliness of the laity alone that shocked
him; the corruption in the Church stood before the eyes of
his soul in yet more glaring colours. He lamented it in his
poems&mdash;highly imaginative and lofty outpourings of a soul
brightened with the fire of love, penetrated with the consciousness
of the need for a higher development, tortured by
a foreboding of approaching judgment.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> His first intention
was to devote himself to teaching rather than to preaching;
but in the seventh year after his entrance into the order, he
was sent to his native city, where he lived as a stranger, rarely
saw even his nearest relatives, and was not much appreciated
as a speaker. Yet he cannot have been lacking in eloquence;
for one day when he was travelling from Ferrara to
Mantua his reproofs made such an impression on the soldiers
who were in the boat playing and swearing, that they penitently
fell upon their knees before him.</p>

<p>Fra Girolamo’s reception in Florence was not encouraging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
The man and the city could not be attractive to each
other; the one was leaning more and more towards asceticism,
and the other towards immoderate pleasure. The one
cared for nothing but Holy Scripture, and developed its
doctrines in lofty, unvarnished speech, whose rough careless
form was not softened by his Lombard accent, his hoarse
voice, and vehement delivery; the other, sharing the common
plight, knew little of the Bible, and was accustomed to
preachers whose artistic phraseology recalled the elegant
tone of the literary palæstra. In his own convent the
stranger found little sympathy. A philosophising tone prevailed
in conversation; and the adoption of classical learning
might well raise some scruples in the mind of the Ferrarese,
whose early education had also been of a philosophical
kind. This double discord left decided marks in its train.
At Savonarola’s Lenten sermons in San Lorenzo in 1483, the
number of listeners was extremely small. He himself was
perfectly aware of the defects of his delivery: ‘Those who
knew me in those days,’ he said ten years later, ‘know that
I had neither voice nor lungs, nor understood anything about
preaching, so that I was a bore to everybody.’ He needed a
longer apprenticeship. For two years he preached during
Lent at San Gemignano. Then he was summoned to
Brescia, where in 1486 he preached the sermons on the Apocalypse
which first extended his reputation, the prophecies
in which of divine judgment and the exhortations to repentance
recurred vividly to the souls of the people six-and-twenty
years later, when the French army was committing
that plunder whose horrors have rarely been equalled in
Christian times. A chapter of the order held at Reggio
brought Savonarola in contact with Giovanni Pico, who
took such an interest in the bold and enthusiastic preacher
that he got him sent back to Florence, through the intervention
of Lorenzo de’ Medici. In 1490 Savonarola returned
to San Marco, there to begin the work which left deep and
broad traces on the ecclesiastical and political history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Italy; which led to hard fighting, not without fault on his
side, but which at last led him to martyrdom, and encircled
his brow with a glory that no contradiction and no change
of times and views have been able to deprive of its radiance.</p>

<p>Savonarola found in Florence a rival who was his exact
opposite in delivery and in opinions. Fra Mariano of Genazzano
came from a place situated on the slope of the
Aequian and Hernican mountains, and made important by
the great palace of the Colonna. He belonged to the order
of the Augustinian Hermits, and dwelt in the convent of
Sto. Spirito, until Lorenzo, with whom he had managed to
get into favour, built a grand convent at the gate of San
Gallo, where there was an old church with a decayed hospital
and a foundling establishment. This building was razed
to the ground in 1524, when the Emperor and a Medicean
Pope were sending their troops against Florence; not a
trace of it is left, and its place is occupied by the rows of
trees and groves of the walk called the Parterre, and the
little church of the Madonna della Tosse, which looks like a
shrine left standing amid the general destruction.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The
convent must have been finished about 1488. Lorenzo provided
it with a choice library, visited it frequently with intimate
friends, and was fond of discussing philosophical and
theological questions with Fra Mariano. Naturally, the
Augustinian was wont to say that among men of such high
position he had never known one so God-fearing as Lorenzo.
As a preacher Fra Mariano was just the man for the people,
as well as for scholars. He was little of stature, but his
voice was full and melodious, and his utterance agreeable;
he terrified and comforted, and made his hearers weep and
laugh. Poliziano describes the impression made on him by
Mariano’s bearing, manner, gestures, and whole appearance,
his sonorous voice, his well-chosen expressions, his majestic
sentences, the artistic construction of his phrases, the harmoniousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
of his cadences, the richness of his imagery, the
clearness and force of his contrasts, the grace of his narrations,
and his easy changes of subject, preventing all
monotony. The picture Poliziano gives of the mode of life
and conversation of this spiritual orator, in whom he celebrates
only the qualities desirable in a temporal one, shows
that Mariano was just the man to sail round the rocks which
threatened to wreck Girolamo. ‘I have met him repeatedly
at the villa and entered into confidential talk with him. I
never knew a man at once more attractive and more cautious.
He neither repels by immoderate severity nor deceives
and leads astray by exaggerated indulgence. Many
preachers think themselves masters of men’s life and death.
While they abuse their power, they always look gloomy, and
weary men by constantly setting up for judges of morals.
But here is a man of moderation. In the pulpit he is a
severe censor; but when he descends, he indulges in winning,
friendly discourse. Therefore, I and my excellent
friend Pico have much intercourse with him, and nothing
refreshes us after our literary labours so much as his conversation.
Lorenzo de’ Medici, who understands men so
well, shows how highly he esteems him, not only in that he
has built him a splendid convent, but also in that he often
visits him, preferring a conversation with him while walking
to any other recreation.’<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Savonarola’s biographer Fra Pacifico Burlamacchi is no
doubt quite right in praising Fra Mariano’s eloquence rather
than his doctrine, in his account of the orator’s little artifice
to impress the people. But this man’s mastery of his art
must have been considerable, to make Girolamo Benivieni
once say to the Ferrarese preacher, ‘Father, no one can
deny the truth, the usefulness, and needfulness of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
teaching. But your delivery lacks attraction, especially
when one is daily led to make a comparison with Fra
Mariano.’ To which the other answered that elegance of
expression must give way to the simple preaching of sound
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> But it was long before Savonarola made his way.
His reputation, indeed, increased rapidly, but admirers still
flocked round Fra Mariano; princes and commonwealth
applied to Lorenzo, begging him to give the Augustinian,
who seemed to be regarded as belonging to his household,
leave to come and preach to them. Lodovico il Moro begged
for this not merely as a personal favour, but because the city
and all the people longed for the fulfilment of Lorenzo’s promise;
and the consuls of the Sabine town of Norcia&mdash;the
home of S. Benedict&mdash;called Fra Mariano in their letter
‘God’s angel upon earth.’</p>

<p>It seems that Fra Girolamo was discouraged by his
former failures in this field, and the growing success of the
Augustinian, and thought at first of limiting his efforts to
the philosophical and theological instruction of the novices.
His short philosophic compendia are only valuable in the
present day for their display of a spirit of justice and sense
of the need of investigation in human knowledge, and of
analytical progress from the known to the unknown, instead
of belief by authority; these, as well as his smaller ascetic
and moral treatises, mostly date from the first years after
his return to Florence. In them may be seen the mystic
enthusiasm which soon became more and more prominent in
his sermons, expositions of the Bible, his poems, and other
important works. Combined with this mysticism was a
striving to clothe his views and prophecies of the future
with the authority of Holy Scripture, with which he was
perhaps better acquainted than anyone else at the time; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
he interpreted it with a freedom, perfectly honest on his
part, which necessarily aroused scruples, for it opened out a
boundless field, where an excited fancy or secondary objects
might easily lead him astray; and this danger was the
greater when he turned his attention especially to the
Apocalypse. In the summer of 1490 divers citizens sought
admission to the lectures for the novices. The convent-rooms
being too small, Savonarola continued his lectures at
first in the court; then, as the number of hearers rapidly increased,
he transferred them on August 1 to the church. A
rosebush still marks the spot where Fra Girolamo taught in
the courtyard of the convent; and in these latter days it has
been resolved to raise a statue to him there, and a bust has
been placed in what was once his cell. He needs no such
monuments where all around recalls his memory; but they
are tokens of the veneration paid to him by posterity in
spite of all his weaknesses and mistakes.</p>

<p>The direction Savonarola had taken soon led him further
than he calculated upon or perhaps intended. The effect
produced by his discourses is quite intelligible when one
compares their character with that of the ordinary preaching
of the day, and takes the prevailing temper into consideration.
In both cases one meets with strange contrasts.
Artificial, wordy discourses, that people were accustomed to
hear in the sermons of the followers of Bernardino of Siena;
besides the simple, often impressive moral, there was a mixture
of abstruse scholasticism, asceticism, and anecdotes intended
for the multitude, on whom, however, part of their
meaning was lost, and who laughed and cried by turns, and
were confirmed in their views of devotional practices and
works, in which too much stress was apt to be laid on externals.
Still the supremacy gained over the people by the
moral and political tendencies favoured by the Medici was
by no means so complete as to leave no room for opposing
views, whose inward strength was only increased by the
outward resistance they encountered. The Dominican’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
subject-matter, his mode of demonstration, his whole manner,
were such as to make an impression upon opponents.
To most preachers as well as hearers, the Bible was a sealed
book. When it was opened its word became a living well
springing up into a mighty fertilising stream, and disclosing
that wondrous power which has never failed wherever it has
been heard. Savonarola well knew that power. If he failed
it was from a defect exactly contrary to those of the others.
They lacked the true perception and feeling for that which
alone could give their teachings a meaning true, deep, and
sound for all time. He lacked moderation and the power
to control his perceptions, his acquirements, and himself.
This was the rock on which he was ultimately wrecked.
Guicciardini, who was ten years old at Lorenzo’s death,
whose youth was passed in the midst of Fra Girolamo’s most
strenuous activity, and whose eyes were early open to all
that went on around him, speaks of the natural unstudied
elegance of the sermons he heard and read, and remarks
that never had there been seen a man so versed in Holy
Scripture, never had such abundant discourse been united
with such a lasting impression.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> In after years, when
Savonarola’s attacks on the corruption in the Church sought
and found a personal object in that Church’s unworthy head,
he encountered in the enmity of other religious societies a
stumbling-block which contributed not a little to his fall.
But even in these earlier days he had long ago roused
opposition, some of which, proceeding from purely inward
grounds, was unavoidable; but a nature less rugged in its
enthusiasm might have broken the force of some of it.</p>

<p>Fra Girolamo’s great day was yet far distant. But this
activity and the effects produced on moral life by his
preaching, by his instructions in the convent, and by his and
his pupils’ influence on all classes, were already beginning
to strike root that year when he gathered around him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
more serious-minded men and youths in San Marco, and set
himself to counteract the dominant pursuit of sensual enjoyment
which threatened to paralyse the energies of the people.
This activity and influence, when its chief source and originator
had personally succumbed, though his work was only
apparently destroyed, was described in glowing words by the
great historian, though he is not quite consistent in his views
of Savonarola’s character. ‘What he did for the amendment
of morals was wonderful and holy. Never did such
order and such fear of God reign in Florence as in his time;
and the deterioration which set in after his death proves
how entirely everything was his work and the fruit of his
labours. There was no more gaming in public, people only
played with trepidation and in private; the taverns, the accustomed
scenes of the wild doings of degenerate youth,
were closed; the worst vices were suppressed in consequence
of the abhorrence excited against them. Most women laid
aside their objectionable garments; the young people were
rescued from their wild ways and led back to a moral life,
and visited the churches in companies. Gamesters, blasphemers,
and dissolute women were in danger of being pursued
and stoned. At the Carnaval, playing-cards, dice,
indecent pictures and books were collected and burnt on the
square of the Signoria; and on the day formerly given up to
all kinds of excesses, a great church procession took place.
The elder people took up a religious life, went diligently to
mass, vespers, and sermons, received the sacraments and distinguished
themselves by doing good. Many youths of the
first families and some men of riper years entered the Predicant
Order. In all Italy was never seen a convent like that
of San Marco, where the excellent instruction given in the
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages and literature promised
to furnish fresh ornaments to the Order.’</p>

<p>This activity, which produced such a change and passed
sentence of condemnation on a system that had been carried
out for years with equal skill and perseverance, was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
beginning in the last years of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s life; but
its very beginnings could not fail to furnish matter for reflection
to that keen thinker. Even before 1490 similar
symptoms had shown themselves, whether connected with
Savonarola’s earliest labours is not certain, but it is highly
probable. Poliziano’s prologue to the Menæchmi of Plautus,
written in May 1488, contains a vehement diatribe against
the opponents of these scenic representations&mdash;those who
protested against the employment of young people in reciting
the too often objectionable verses of classical plays.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Monks are the objects of the poet’s attack; monks who were
not like his friend Mariano.</p>

<p class="p1">These lines, recited in Lorenzo’s presence, are witnesses
to the existence of the opposition which increased in strength
every year, and from whose influence many, even of those
who sided with the ruling party, seem not to have been free.
In Lent 1491 Fra Girolamo began to preach in Sta. Maria
del Fiore, the crowd having now become too great for the
conventual church; the number of hearers increased daily,
the impression made by his predictions of the punishment
and evil to come became more vivid, till Lorenzo thought it
advisable to try to stem the tide of growing excitement
which threatened to endanger his work and his influence.
For these prophecies of approaching judgment contained
something more than indirect attacks on the present state
of affairs, and the serious turn of mind encouraged by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
preacher most necessarily deprive of their force many of the
means which served to maintain that state of affairs.</p>

<p>Five chief citizens of the dominant party&mdash;men who all,
with one exception, later on personally fell under the mighty
influence of Savonarola&mdash;Domenico Bonsi, Guid’Antonio
Vespucci, Paol’Antonio Soderini, Bernardo Rucellai, and
Francesco Valori, went to San Marco to exhort the preacher
to moderation. He answered that they had better exhort Lorenzo,
who had sent them, to repent of his sins: God would
spare no one. To the warning that he might be exiled, he replied
that Lorenzo was a Florentine citizen and he a stranger;
but the former would go and he would remain. He predicted
the speedy death of Lorenzo, the Pope, and King Ferrante.
The increasing and very intelligible discontent among the
Medicean partisans, of which he could not but be aware, led
him, however, to try and moderate his too frequent and exciting
prophecies and confine himself more to moral and
theological lectures. But his restless spirit carried him
away. It would have been well for him could he have
known moderation. But as his imagery, at once brilliant
and irregular, is confusing and bewildering rather than
elevating; as the terrors of his curse are weakened by repetition;
as his precepts for Christian life rise to a pitch of
asceticism, whose very exaggeration contains its own contradiction;
as his teaching, so truly that of the Gospel in its
principles and right application, loses its impressive force by
straying to unsuitable ground; even so was it with his conduct
in life. He irritated needlessly and aimlessly. The
benefactions of the Medici to the convent and to the whole
order had founded a relation of clientship, in which there
was nothing offensive so long as both parties observed the
moderation which had once been guaranteed by Cosimo’s
cautiousness and was continued by Lorenzo’s tact and discretion.
It was customary that when a new prior was appointed
he should make a visit to the head of the family.
Fra Girolamo, on being chosen prior in July 1491, refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to do this. ‘I hold my election from God alone,’ said he; ‘to
Him alone I owe obedience.’ It may easily be conceived
that Lorenzo took this amiss, and, in his turn, spoke out
freely. ‘A stranger has come into my house, and does not
deign to visit me.’ However, he made no change in his
conduct towards the convent; he sent gifts and money as
before. Once some gold florins were found in the alms-box
of the church. Fra Girolamo, who had previously made
some personal remarks from the pulpit, caused the money to
be given to the Buonuomini of San Martino, saying that
silver and copper was enough for the convent. When Lorenzo
came to walk in the convent garden, according to his custom,
the prior never showed himself. His admirers praise his
conduct towards a man from whom he was separated by a
deep inward gulf. If, instead of trying to work upon that
man and so introduce a different state of things, he intended
to cause a violent conflict, he acted rightly.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s own conduct towards Savonarola was always
prudent. The Dominican’s biographers relate that the great
man, being repulsed by him, incited Fra Mariano to attack
him from the pulpit; but such incitement was probably not
needed. The breach between the two preachers was older
than themselves; the antagonism of the two orders was but
personified in these men, so radically different from each
other. In a sermon preached on Ascension-Day, on the
text: ‘It is not for you to know the times or the seasons,’
the Augustinian accused the prior of San Marco of being a
false prophet, an instigator of sedition among the people, a
stirrer-up of strife and disorder. It is said that his vehemence
and exaggerated personalities gave offence to his numerous
hearers, and ruined his fame as an orator. Seven years
later, when the Roman court was in the greatest excitement
on account of events in Florence, when Savonarola lay under
the ban of the Church, when his safety and his very life depended
only on the momentary preponderance of one party
or another in the excited city, already stained with the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
of noble citizens&mdash;then this same Fra Mariano preached in
Sant’Agostino at Rome in such immoderate terms, and
applied to his hated rival such coarse expressions, that even
to unlearned hearers his gifts of eloquence seemed to have
been swallowed up by party-spirit; and the cardinals who
were present turned their backs upon him. They had expected
a refutation of the Dominican’s teaching, and they
heard nothing but raging accusations accompanied by vulgar
gestures.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> ‘If you want to understand a monk, ask a monk
about him,’ so said the Augustinian. After his personal
attack at Florence, it is said that Fra Mariano, apparently
regardless of his discomfiture, invited his rival to San Gallo,
where they celebrated a solemn mass together and exchanged
civilities; but the story does not agree with Savonarola’s
character and the frankness so much praised by his biographers
in his relations with Lorenzo.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">PROCLAMATION OF THE CARDINALATE OF GIOVANNI
DE’ MEDICI.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a wise decision of Lorenzo to fix on Pisa as a residence
for his son Giovanni. His efforts to raise that unfortunate
city and to bridge over as much as he could the gulf
between it and Florence had been unwearying. Moreover,
Pisa not only offered to the youth, in the persons of its
learned men, ample means of scientific cultivation, it also
gave the needful quiet which, while his elevation to a great
dignity was an open secret, he could not find in his father’s
house, constantly filled with friends and clients. Philosophy,
law, and polite literature seem to have been Giovanni’s
chief studies; his whole after-life shows that he was
not much taken up with theology. Filippo Decio and Bartolommeo
Sozzini were his chief instructors in civil and
ecclesiastical law. With his quick mind his studies were a
pleasure; and the uncommon capacity which he always
displayed in literary matters, independently of the accurate
taste he inherited from his father, and his perfect mastery of
the Latin tongue, suffice to show that he no more lost his
time at Pisa than he had done in the villa or the house at
Florence. He always attached great weight to Latin
scholarship, as he proved by his choice of secretaries when
he became Pope. In a brief of 1517, he speaks of the enrichment
of the Latin tongue, doubtless alluding both to the
increased publicity of its master-pieces, and to the efforts
made, in accordance with Poliziano’s views, to apply that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
language to the purposes of modern science and modern life,
instead of confining it to mere imitation, yet without offending
against the severity of the classical. His tutor Bernardo
Michelozzi has already been mentioned. Chalkondylas and
Peter of Ægina are named as his instructors in Greek. His
constant companion was Bernardo Dovizj, in whom he
placed as much confidence as Lorenzo had given to his
father, and, indeed, also gave to the son. Another of Giovanni’s
companions was Silvio Passerini, who belonged to
the Cortona branch of a good Florentine family, and whose
father was one of the stanchest adherents of the Medici.
Lorenzo caused the boy to be brought up with his second
son; and Silvio, who was five years older than Giovanni,
followed him faithfully through prosperity and adversity.
In later days he enjoyed the revived glory of the family, and
was raised to the highest ecclesiastical dignities, and also to
civil power in Florence; but he showed himself unequal to
the situation when another storm overthrew the Medicean
authority.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The degree of doctor of canon law had already
been conferred on Giovanni. Towards the end of his stay
at Pisa he had a strange fellow-student&mdash;the Cardinal vice-chancellor
Rodrigo Borgia’s son Cesare, who was studying
jurisprudence under the future Cardinals Vera and Romolino,
and attended the lectures of Filippo Decio.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Naturally Giovanni held a prominent position, and his
influence was reckoned on in favour of the city and university,
as well as for private persons. His letters to his father,
mostly short, are written in the tone of respect and obedience
which at that time universally characterised the relation of
children to their parents, and in a great degree does so still.
He occasionally retired to the solitude of Camaldoli for the
purpose of meditation and of indulging in the spiritual exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
usual to one in his circumstances. In the beginning
of August 1491, he was residing in the abbey of Passignano
with his cousin Giulio. Lorenzo had not ceased interceding
for benefices for his son. When a Tuscan abbot was dying
in May 1489, he wrote to the ambassador at Rome: ‘Induce
the Pope to give the benefice to his Messer Giovanni. I
say <i>his</i>, because he is far more his servant than my son.
On account of the importance of the benefice, his Holiness
should confer it only on one of our people (Florentines), and
if it is given to one of ours, it can come to no one who will
be more thankful for it.’<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>The Pope’s stipulation for delay in proclaiming Giovanni
cardinal did not at all suit Lorenzo, and he took no pains to
conceal the fact. Within a year from the nomination he
was urgent to have it published immediately; but Innocent
was not to be moved. ‘I thanked his Holiness,’ wrote on
January 8, 1490, Piero Alamanni,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> temporarily replacing
Lanfredini, who had died three days before, ‘for Messer
Giovanni’s preferment, and declared how gratifying it was
to our whole people, and how grateful they are to the Holy
Father; at the same time I hinted, in the most suitable
words I could command, that a shortening of the appointed
delay was greatly desired. In his detailed reply, the Pope
remarked first that what he did was all for the best, and for
the reasons and grounds which he had communicated to you
through M. Pier Filippo (Pandolfini). Then he turned the
conversation to M. Giovanni, and spoke of him in such a
way as if he were his own son. He said he had been informed
what progress he was making in his studies at Pisa,
and how he had distinguished himself in several disputations;
at which he showed extreme pleasure. At last he spoke as
follows: “Leave me to care for Messer Giovanni’s interests,
for I regard him as my son, and shall of my own accord
take in hand his proclamation when you are least thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
of it. I have yet other views for his honour and advantage.“‘
This was all very fine, but it was the less calculated to soothe
Lorenzo’s impatience, as the Pope’s state of health gave good
cause for the gravest anxiety. On September 23, Innocent
was seized with another apoplectic fit. All Rome was in the
most intense excitement; the Pope’s death was reported;
all shops were closed, and all persons working in the fields
and vineyards hurried home. Franceschetto Cybò tried to
get possession both of the church treasury and of Prince
Dschem, in consequence of which, on the following day,
while Innocent still lay unconscious, the cardinals took precautionary
measures; not, however, it was said, till part of
the treasure had been sent to Florence.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The invalid came to
himself, and on May 27 Pandolfini wrote that he was getting
better and hopeful of recovery. It is related that he said to
Cardinal Savelli and his colleagues, who came to the palace
in the moment of danger to secure the treasure, ‘he hoped
yet to bury them all.’ But there was great alarm at Florence.
As soon as the news of the Pope’s critical condition arrived,
Guid’Antonio Vespucci and Piero Guicciardini were commissioned
to go to Rome to demand, in the name of the city,
the admission of Giovanni de’ Medici to the approaching
Conclave. More favourable news made the embassy needless,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
but Lorenzo determined to make every effort not to let his
success be spoiled. His brother-in-law, the archbishop, was
then in Florence, and went to Rome at his request. Through
Franceschetto’s mediation he obtained admission to the Pope,
whom he found suffering from quartan fever, and in a state
which did not at all inspire confidence. His mission had no
success with the influential cardinals; his letter to Lorenzo<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
shows how slightingly he was treated. All he gained was
the assurance that the family, and especially Lorenzo, should
be treated with consideration and not offended. When he
became more urgent on the subject of the Conclave, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
told that matters had not got so far as that yet; the Pope
was well, and should anything fatal happen to him, they
would proceed with due consideration. Pandolfini, too,
obtained nothing. On the part of the cardinals, he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
there would be no serious difficulty; it lay with the Pope,
who was afraid of publication in this individual case, lest it
should offend others. ‘Do not think that to speak of the
matter at the present moment would lead to the attainment
of the object. Everyone is warned to speak to him only of
cheerful things, and that only in the presence of others. If
one tried to obtain an interview without witnesses, one would
expose oneself to the suspicion that it was for something of
importance. For more than a month not a cardinal has
spoken with him, save those belonging to the palace; and of
the prelates, only those who cheer him up are admitted.’</p>

<p>The Pope’s health really became stronger; and as he remained
firm, Lorenzo had to wait patiently till the three
years’ delay was over. When the moment arrived, neither
Innocent nor the young cardinal’s father could hope to live
much longer. On the afternoon of March 8, 1492, Giovanni,
who had in the meantime left Pisa, proceeded with a small
retinue to the abbey of Fiesole. That convent and church,
where everything recalled the munificence of the Medici, had
been chosen to witness the conferring of the highest honours
upon a scion of the family. The next morning Pico della
Mirandola and Jacopo Salviati arrived with the notary Simone
Staza, and at the sixth hour they accompanied the youth to
the church. The office of the Madonna was solemnly sung
and was followed by the sacrifice of the mass, the celebrant,
the Prior Matteo Bosso, giving the Host to Giovanni as he
knelt on the altar-steps. He then blessed the cardinal’s
robes, took in his hands the Pope’s bull and brief and said:
‘May it be for the good of God’s church, of our country, and
of thy house! This day, Giovanni Medici, the three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>’
delay appointed by the bull and this brief for thy dignity as
cardinal is expired. Whosoever will read, let him read; all
is fulfilled. Do thou, Simone, make a public record of it.’
He then presented to the kneeling youth his insignia, the
pallium, biretta, hat, and ring, and the choir sang the <i>Veni
Creator</i>. After proclaiming the indulgences to which he was
now competent, the cardinal returned to the convent with
the rest. After dinner Piero de’ Medici arrived mounted on
a handsome horse adorned with gilded trappings, and accompanied
by some friends of the family; and the whole
party mounted on horseback to proceed to the city.</p>

<p>In spite of the rainy weather thousands had crowded to
the Porta San Gallo to see the procession. To avoid a press
a regulation had been made that no one should cross the
bridge over the Mugnone; so the whole space before the
gate and the convent was filled with people. When the
cardinal and his companions rode up, they found the whole
of the clergy, protonotaries and prelates, the chief citizens,
and the foreign ambassadors. On reaching the city the procession
entered the Servite Church, where Giovanni prayed
in the chapel of the Annunziata, and thence to Sta. Maria
del Fiore. After this the cardinal paid a visit to the
Signoria, and then, accompanied by the ambassadors, rode
to his father’s house, where Lorenzo received his son. The
streets through which the procession passed were gaily
decorated, and the windows and roofs filled with people.
The whole population was astir. At night the houses and
numerous towers were brilliant with illuminations; bonfires
were lighted in the squares, so that it was as bright as daylight,
and shouts of rejoicing and the sound of musical instruments
continued so long that sleep seemed forgotten.
The next morning, Sunday, March 10, the grand ecclesiastical
celebration took place in Sta. Maria del Fiore, whither
the cardinal was accompanied by the ambassadors and chief
citizens. The church was full; the Signoria were present:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
eight bishops sang the Mass of the Holy Ghost. It was not
fourteen years since the blood of a Medici had been shed on
that spot, in the presence of another youthful cardinal.
After Mass, Giovanni took leave of the Signoria and returned
home, where a grand banquet was prepared in his honour.
Sixty covers were laid; the guests were the foreign diplomatists
and the foremost men of the city. For several days preparations
had been made and provisions procured ‘for the
solemnity of our Monsignore.’<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Lorenzo was so ill on his
son’s day of triumph that he could not take part either in
the service at church or at the banquet. He had himself
carried into the hall to see the brilliant company at table;
that was all he could do. Before the end of the banquet the
Signoria presented to the new Prince of the Church a gift
of honour, consisting of silver plate of the finest workmanship
and more than a thousand pounds in weight; its value
was estimated at 10,000 gold florins at the least. After
Giovanni had withdrawn to his own apartments with the
ambassadors and Signori, the various communities of the
State, and the Jews of Florence, sent him presents of handsome
silver plate; all of which, as also gifts from private
persons, except his own relatives, he immediately returned
with thanks.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Little more than two years and a half after this day of
triumph, he whom Florence now greeted with acclamations left
his desolate home in the habit of a Franciscan monk; the
convent of St. Mark, built by his family, closed its gates
against him, and the terrified fugitive turned towards the
Apennines; thus beginning an exile destined to last for
eighteen years, to be followed later on by a period of yet
greater, and, in its way, unequalled splendour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanni stayed but one day more in his native city.
He had to go to Rome to express his thanks to the Pope
and take his place in the Sacred College. On Tuesday,
March 12, he took leave of his sick father and set off on
horseback, accompanied by his suite. Among the latter was
the general of the Camaldulensians, Pietro Delfino, descended
from a noble Venetian family; he had been formerly in the
monastery of San Michele di Murano, was elected general of
his Order in 1480, and was a great friend of Lorenzo and
other distinguished Florentines; no one could be better
fitted to direct the first steps of a youth raised to such high
honours. A letter written by him from Rome to Guido,
prior of the monastery of the Angeli, gives an account of
the journey and reception. For two miles from the Porta
Romana, as far as the Carthusian convent, the departing
cardinal was escorted by a number of distinguished citizens;
they then returned to Florence, and he rode on to his abbey
of Passignano. The greater part of his suite went to pass
the night at Poggibonzi, and on the following morning
reached Siena, where the cardinal arrived in the afternoon,
and was triumphantly and joyfully received by the people.
March 16 the party resumed their journey, and dined at
Buonconvento; they passed that night at San Quirico and
the next at Acquapendente. Throughout the Sienese territory
they were entertained at the public expense. Several
prelates came to meet the cardinal at Acquapendente, and
he was saluted on the way to Viterbo by several of the Orsini
whose territories near the lake of Bolsena bordered on those
of Siena.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>At Viterbo Franceschetto Cybò received his brother-in-law,
and all rode together to Bracciano, whose lord, Gentil
Virginio Orsini, had gone eight miles, up to the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Viterbo mountains, to meet the welcome guest. They were
all housed in the gigantic pentagonal fortress, impregnable
in those days, and even now startling in its gloomy grandeur
as it towers above the slumbering depths of the lake below.
The travellers spent a whole day with the powerful lord of
Bracciano, who in a few years was ruined by the same storm
that overthrew the Medici. On the following day, March 22,
the Pope announced to the cardinals and envoys the approaching
arrival of the new member of the Sacred College. It
took place in the afternoon amid pouring rain. Giovanni
dismounted at Sta. Maria del Popolo, prayed in the church
and slept in the convent, and the next morning his colleagues
and the ambassadors came to fetch him. Francesco Piccolomini
and Raffael Riario headed the procession; Giovanni
himself rode between the cardinal-deacons Giovan Battista
Savelli and Giovanni Colonna. The new cardinal-deacon of
Sta. Maria in Dominica was received by the Pope in the Consistory.
After the ceremony they all escorted him back to
his dwelling in the Campo di Fiore, and the rain was unceasing.
Pietro Delfino reports that the youth’s bearing
and conduct made a favourable impression on all, and he
was thought more mature in mind than was to be expected
from his age; which may be accounted for by considering
what great care his father, who himself had been early brought
into public life, had bestowed upon his son’s education, and
what a lasting impression was left on that son by the father’s
example.</p>

<p>The letter addressed by Lorenzo to Giovanni<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> is an
honourable proof not merely of political wisdom and consummate
knowledge of human affairs, but also of a genuine
sense of propriety and a moral feeling which seems to have
been strengthened by the experience of advancing years and
his own personal circumstances. ‘Messer Giovanni,’ thus
runs the letter, ‘you, and we for your sake owe sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
thankfulness to our Lord God. For over and above many
benefits and honours conferred on our house, He has granted
to it in your person the highest dignity to which it has ever
risen. The matter, already great in itself, is made yet far
greater by the circumstances, namely, your youth and our
position. My earnest exhortation to you, therefore, is that
you endeavour yourself to be thankful to God; for it is not
your deserts nor your prudence and foresight that have made
you a cardinal, but the wondrous grace of God. This you
must recognise, and prove your recognition of it by an
honest, exemplary, virtuous life. To this you are all the
more bound, as in your youth you have already given an impression
of yourself which furnishes reason to expect riper
fruits. It would be a shame for you and a sad disappointment
for me, if you forgot your good beginnings at an age
when others are wont to arrive at discretion and a regular
life. You must, therefore, be careful to lighten the burden
of the dignity conferred on you by a moral course of life,
and perseverance in the studies befitting your vocation.
Last year it was a great comfort to me to hear that, without
being exhorted by others, you went frequently to confession
and to the Lord’s Table; and I believe that there is no
better means of continuing in the grace of God than constant
perseverance in this practice. It seems to me that I
can give no more useful and suitable exhortation than this.
As you are going to Rome, the very pit of all evil, the difficulty
of doing what I recommend naturally increases; for
not only does example have its influence, but you personally
will have no lack of evil counsellors and tempters. As you
can understand for yourself, your elevation to the cardinalate
excites great envy, on account both of your youth and of the
other circumstances to which I have alluded. Those who
were unable to hinder that elevation will endeavour artfully
to diminish its value, by trying to make your manner of life
appear in an unfavourable light, and to drag you down into
the pit into which they themselves are fallen. They trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
that your youth will make this easier to them. You must
take the more pains to frustrate these hopes, as there is the
less virtue to be found now in the College [‘quanto nel
Collegio hora si vede manco virtù’]. I remember seeing
that College full of learned and virtuous men; be advised to
follow their example; for the more your course of life differs
from that of others, the more you will be sure of being loved
and esteemed. But you must flee the reproach of hypocrisy
as well as that of an evil reputation, like Scylla and Charybdis.
You must endeavour to cultivate moderation, and both
in your conduct and speech avoid everything which might
offend others, and not make a display of austerity and strictness.
These are things which you will understand with
time, and learn to act up to my meaning better than I can
explain it to you now.</p>

<p>‘You will have no difficulty in perceiving how much depends
on the individuality and example of a Cardinal. If
the Cardinals were what they should be, the world would
be the better for it; for they would always choose a good
Pope and thus secure the peace of Christendom. Endeavour
therefore to so comport yourself, that others in resembling
you will promote the general well being of all. As there
is nothing in the world more difficult than to converse
fittingly with people of different sorts, I can give you no
minute instruction on this point. But in all cases you must
take care to be respectful and unpretending in your intercourse
with the Cardinals and others of high rank, and
measure things with a calm judgment and not according to
the passions of others; for many violate reason in aiming at
that which is unlawful. Keep your own conscience at peace
by giving no place in your discourse to offensive matters.
This seems to me in your case the first and most important
precept; for if anyone should let himself be led into enmity
by passion, the return is easy with such as have no sound
reason for disagreement. During this your first stay in
Rome, I think you will do well to use your ears more than
your tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>‘This day I have given you up wholly to God and the
holy Church. Therefore you must become a good priest and
convince everyone that you prefer the good and honour of
the Church and of the Apostolic See to all the things of this
world, and all private considerations and interests. If you
keep this before your eyes you will not lack opportunities
of being useful to this city and our house. For the alliance
with the Church is advantageous to the city; you must
form the link between the two; and the house goes with the
city. And although the future cannot be foreseen, yet I
have a general belief that we shall not lack means on both
sides if you hold firmly to this most important resolution
that I urge on you of placing the Church before all else.</p>

<p>‘You are the youngest member of the College; not only
at the present time, but of all that have ever hitherto been
created. Therefore you must be attentive and respectful
when you meet the other Cardinals, and never make people
wait for you at chapel, in the Consistory, or at a deputation.
You will soon discover which of your colleagues are most,
and which are least commendable. You will have to avoid
confidential intercourse with those of irregular lives, not
only on account of the thing itself, but also on account of
public opinion. Let your discourse with all men turn as
much as possible on indifferent subjects. When you have
to appear in public or solemn occasions, it seems to me
advisable rather to moderate your outward enthusiasm than
to overstep it. I would prefer a well-filled stable, and well-ordered
cleanly servants, to pomp and riches. Try to live
regularly, and gradually to introduce fixed order, which is
unattainable at present, while master and household are
alike unknown to each other. Silk and jewels suit your
position on certain occasions only; far more suitable are
a few good antiquities and fine books, and respectable and
learned, rather than numerous society. Rather invite
people frequently to you than go to many entertainments;
but herein also you must proceed with moderation. Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
for your own use simple food, and take a great deal of
exercise, for in your present position you might easily be
overcome by some illness for want of prudence. This
position is no less secure than lofty; so that it often happens
that those who have attained it become negligent, saying
to themselves that they have reached a lofty goal, and thinking
that they can keep it without much effort; thereby often
bringing injury to their position as well as to their health.
With respect to the latter I advise you to be as careful as
possible, and to have rather too little than too much confidence
in your strength.</p>

<p>‘One rule of life I commend to you before all others:
get up early every morning. Putting aside the benefit
to health, it gives time for attending to all the business
of the day, and you will find it a great assistance in fulfilling
your various duties, as you have to read your service, to
study, to give audiences and do various other things.
Another thing is very useful for one in your position: always,
and particularly now at first, consider in the evening
what you have to do the next day, that business may not
find you unprepared. As for speaking in the Consistory, I
am of opinion that in all cases which may occur it will, on
account of your youth and inexperience, be most praiseworthy
and befitting the circumstances that you should always
follow the Holy Father and his wise judgment. Without
doubt you will often be urged to speak to his Holiness
about particular matters and use your influence. Be careful
now at first to ask as little as possible and not trouble the
Holy Father; for he is naturally inclined to grant the most
to him who dins least into his ears. I think it salutary to
take care not to weary him, but to lay before him pleasant
things; and a request modestly preferred corresponds better
with his nature and will put him in a more favourable disposition.
Fare you well.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">DEATH OF LORENZO.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">When</span> Lorenzo wrote that letter to his son his condition
might be called hopeless. From his youth up he had suffered
from hereditary physical ailments. The attacks had increased
with age, till they weakened his originally strong
constitution. Gout made its appearance in various forms,
and the waters, tried frequently and one after another, failed
to give lasting relief, partly because he never gave them
time to produce their full effect. He often joked about his
sufferings. ‘Pain in my feet,’ he wrote to Lanfredini in
August 1489, ‘has hindered my correspondence with you.
Feet and tongue are indeed far apart, yet they interfere with
each other.’ Towards the end of August 1491, he was so
ill that he had to be carried to Spedaletto in a litter.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The
waters of Morba had only a passing soothing effect; and at
the end of the autumn a slow fever set in with grave symptoms.
His whole system seemed attacked at once&mdash;bowels,
limbs, and nerves. To the arthritic pains were added pains
in the bones, which robbed him of rest by night and day;
gout had attacked the higher organs: the physicians were
at their wits’ end. When the year 1492 opened, he could
see no one; all grave political business had to be set aside;
a Milanese ambassador waited more than a fortnight for an
audience. An improvement permitted him to leave the
house again, but it was not lasting. ‘The illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
Lorenzo,’ wrote the Ferrarese ambassador on February 11,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
‘has been again for some days greatly tormented with pains
which attack the whole of his body except his head. At
times he suffers so acutely that it is hard to understand
how he can hold out. The doctors do not indeed consider
the illness mortal; but his condition is getting very bad,
because he enjoys very little rest. God grant him health
again; for the accounts of his state are really such as to
excite sympathy.’ On the 8th of the same month, King
Ferrante wrote to his ambassador, Marino Tomacelli:<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> ‘We
have received many letters from you, but now we only reply
concerning the long-continued sufferings of the illustrious
Lorenzo, which have grieved and do grieve us to the depths
of our soul. Would God we could procure him recovery, or
even alleviation! Exhort his Magnificence to arm himself
with patience and thus overcome the evil; more especially
as we may now expect better weather, after these last days
which have indeed been bad. Inform his Magnificence also
that we congratulate him on the settlement of the dispute
with his Holiness, which must be as pleasing to him as to
ourself, he having had so great a share in it, as is known to
us and all. May he, by God’s help, the advice of good
doctors and prudence on his own part, recover his health,
so that we may both enjoy peace, and especially peace of
mind.’</p>

<p>The king was not deceived in his estimate of how much
depended on Lorenzo’s life and activity. In the middle of
February an improvement set in, but again it was but
transitory. The weather continued bad, and at the beginning
of March the pains returned; no one was admitted to
the invalid with the exception of his family and a very few intimate
friends. We remarked before that he was unable to take
part in the solemnities attending the proclamation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
son’s cardinalate; his most ardent wish was now fulfilled,
and his life was on the wane. He seems to have been aware
of his condition, when the young Cardinal set out on March
12. He spoke thus to Filippo Valori, brother of his biographer,
and Andrea Carubini, the former of whom was to
accompany Giovanni to Rome, and the latter was attached
to his household: ‘I entrust my son’s youth to you; me
you will never see again.’ Who can tell what were his feelings
as he wrote that beautiful letter!&mdash;There was again a
slight improvement; but it was the last. The disease made
rapid progress. On the 21st the invalid was taken to
Careggi, his favourite abode, where he had planned and
done so much, and where he could get more air and sunshine
than in the city. Towards the end of March a physician
was expected from Naples. At the beginning of April,
Duke Ercole of Ferrara came to Florence<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> on his journey
to Rome, whither he was going ostensibly for purposes of
devotion, in reality for political objects, and to try to obtain
the cardinalate for his son Ippolito. The boy was only
thirteen, but he had already been Archbishop of Gran for
six years; and if a Medici had won the purple at fourteen, why
not an Este, a scion of one of the oldest families of Italy?
If Innocent VIII. had lived longer he would have been unable
to avoid giving this nomination also. The duke could not
see Lorenzo, but the latter had already promised him his
son’s vote in the future Consistory.</p>

<p>The sufferer’s days were numbered. He made himself
ready for the worst, set his house in order, and made what
arrangements he could to secure for his son the position he
had himself held. But he was too clear-sighted not to perceive
the dangers which the old love of freedom and impatience
under the long and ever-strengthening supremacy
of a single family, together with Piero’s inexperience and
haughty character, must bring upon him. Poliziano indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
relates that Lorenzo had cherished an intention of retiring,
and handing over the direction of affairs to his son. ‘About
two years before his death,’ he says, ‘I was sitting with him
in his bed-chamber, and we were talking, as usual, of philosophy
and literature. He then said that he intended passing
the rest of his days with Ficino, Pico, and myself, in study,
far from the bustle of the city. To my objection that this
would be impossible, as the citizens needed his counsel and
authority more and more every day, he answered smiling:
“I shall provide a substitute in the person of thy pupil, and
entrust the burden to his shoulders.“‘ Then on Poliziano’s
expressing a doubt whether Piero’s age was sufficient to
render him competent, he praised his son’s mind and bearing,
and the good foundations which Poliziano had laid.
The story may be true, notwithstanding the writer’s visible
tendency to over-rate his friend’s actions and sayings. But
doubtless Lorenzo’s sole object was to hear what would be
said to such an intention. He can hardly have had serious
thoughts of retiring from public life, least of all at such a
time.</p>

<p>Looking back upon his own short but eventful career, he
could see more clearly than ever what unceasing care and
trouble, what knowledge of characters and calculation of
humours and circumstances, had been necessary to govern
parties, keep down opponents without driving them to extremity,
and make use of and direct adherents without letting
them outgrow his control. He knew but too well that a
single false step might upset everything. In the depths of
his own mind he felt the discords that ran through the
general tone of thought and feeling in the state. He measured
the force of the hardly-concealed moral and religious
currents that were threatening to break forth. When he,
the experienced statesman, looked around him and surveyed
the political condition of Italy, he was alarmed at the weak
foundations of the edifice which it had cost him so much
exertion to support by his counsels and actions. But just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
now he had put an end to the long and dangerous strife between
the Pope and the King; and who was to answer for
the future? And when the unstable Pope and the unprincipled
King were gone, who could predict the former’s successor&mdash;who
dared flatter himself with the hope that the
latter’s heir, in every respect worse than himself, would keep
even his own disaffected land at peace, and not foster the
seeds, sown long ago, of dissensions with other countries?
Perhaps Lorenzo’s death-bed was haunted even more by the
consciousness of the preponderance of evil elements in the
College, by the thoughts of Alfonso of Naples, of Lodovico il
Moro, and of the hostility of Venice, than even by the dread
of attempts at a change in Florence.</p>

<p>In his religious views and his mode of expressing them
Lorenzo had always been a true child of the age, which combined
a secular temper with a tinge of unfeigned religious
feeling, and amid all its grave intellectual errors was not
without moral consciousness. That Lorenzo possessed this
moral consciousness is proved by many of his expressions
through his latter years. He had gained from his excellent
and pious mother something more than a literary acquaintance
with religious matters. He had inherited from his
forefathers the traditions of a close and active connection
with ecclesiastical foundations and ecclesiastical interests,
which he furthered in a manner that cannot be attributed
solely to political motives. His sensuous temperament, his
early elevation to such authority as perhaps no private man
has ever enjoyed in a city so full of genuine life, led him into
many moral errors. But as he was at the same time the
author of the lays of the Carnaval and the poet of philosophical
and spiritual songs, even so, amid all his errors and notwithstanding
the great influence exercised over him from his
youth up by antique philosophy, he still adhered to the faith
of Christianity practised and taught by his teacher Ficino
and his friend Pico della Mirandola. All his life he had been
attentive to the observance of religious ordinances; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
continued so when that life was near its close. His sister
Bianca de’ Pazzi had accompanied him to Careggi; and it
was she who told him of his imminent danger. ‘Brother,’
said she, ‘thou hast lived as a man of lofty mind; thou must
quit this life not only bravely but piously. Know that all
hope is over.’<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> He seemed somewhat distressed that hope
had been encouraged too long; then he asked for the aid of
the Church. It was late when the priest who was summoned
from San Lorenzo reached the villa. The dying man would
not receive him in bed: in spite of the remonstrances of
those about him, he got up and had himself dressed: then,
supported by his attendants, he entered the room, where he
sank on his knees before the ciborium. Seeing how weak he
was, the priest insisted that he should lie down again; and
he was with difficulty induced to do so. He then received
the viaticum with a devoutness which made an impression on
all present.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>His eldest son, his sister, and Angelo Poliziano were
almost constantly near him. After the religious ceremony
Piero remained alone by his bedside. Lorenzo comforted
him, and gave him warnings and good advice as to his conduct
in the city and the state when he himself should have
departed. ‘The citizens,’ said he, ‘will, I believe, acknowledge
thee, my son, as worthy to fill the position which I have
occupied; and I doubt not that thou wilt have the same
authority in the commonwealth as I have enjoyed until now.
But as this commonwealth is, according to the common expression,
a body with many heads, and it is impossible to
please them all, remember that in all the varied circumstances
of life the way to be kept is that which appears most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
honourable; and always prefer the general good to personal
and party interests.’ Wise counsel this; if he who gave it
had but followed it more strictly, it would have saved him
from much bitter and but too well-founded reproach! He
charged Piero to take a father’s place towards his young
brother Giuliano; to the Cardinal he commended his nephew
Giulio, then aged fourteen, and for whom he seems already
to have had visions of an ecclesiastical career. He also spoke
to his son about his funeral, ordering that it should be
arranged after the pattern of his grandfather’s, and that the
limits usual in the interment of a private man should not be
overstepped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a famous Lombard doctor, Lazaro of Pavia, sent
by Lodovico il Moro, had arrived at Careggi. The invalid
asked the attendants what he was doing, and on being told
that he was composing a draught of pulverised pearls, precious
stones, and other costly substances, he exclaimed with eager
voice and cheerful look to Poliziano, who was standing near
the bed: ‘Dost thou hear, Angelo, dost thou hear?’ Then,
stretching out his enfeebled arms, he seized his friend by
both hands and held him fast, while the latter sought to
turn away to hide the rising tears; at last Lorenzo, seeing
his emotion, let him go, and he rushed to his own rooms to
let his grief take its course. When he came back, Lorenzo
asked why Pico did not come to see him; and being answered
that probably Pico feared to trouble him, he remarked that
he rather feared it was the distance from the villa to the city
that troubled Pico. The latter, thus called for, came; and
the invalid received him with the old cordiality. He begged
him to excuse the trouble he was giving him, adding that it
must be attributed to his affection, for he should die more
content after having seen him once more. Then he spoke on
many subjects, both general and particular, and said, looking
at the two: ‘I would that death had spared me till I had
been able to complete your libraries.’ Poliziano knelt down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
beside the bed to catch the words, which were already becoming
indistinct.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Pico left Careggi when another man entered
the chamber of death.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> If Lorenzo summoned Girolamo
Savonarola to him, it must have been because he was not
easy in his conscience. The several versions of the interview,
as related by those who were connected either with Lorenzo
or the Dominican Prior, differ so widely as to the circumstances
that only greater or less probability can decide
between them. This is Poliziano’s story: Fra Girolamo of
Ferrara, a man distinguished by his learning and godliness,
and an excellent preacher of the Divine Word, entered the
room, and admonished the invalid to hold fast to the Faith;
to which Lorenzo replied that he continued immovable
therein. Hereupon he exhorted him thenceforth to lead a
virtuous life; to which the reply was that he would endeavour
himself so to do. Thirdly, he recommended him to meet
death, if it needs must be, with firmness. ‘Nothing,’ replied
the invalid, ‘is sweeter to me, if it be God’s will.’ The monk
was departing, when Lorenzo said to him: ‘Give me thy
blessing, father, before thou partest from me.’ And with
bowed head, and in the attitude of religious earnestness, he
responded correctly, and with full consciousness to Savonarola’s
words and prayers, undisturbed by the no longer concealed
mourning of the household.</p>

<p>So reports the friend of many years&mdash;he who knew the
dying man better perhaps than anyone else. But another
story stands in opposition to his. According to this version,
Lorenzo wished to make one last confession to the Dominican.
He accused himself of three things: the sack of Volterra,
the squandering of the dower-moneys, and the blood shed at
the time of the Pazzi conspiracy. The dying man’s agitation
was distressing. ‘God is gracious, God is merciful,’ said the
monk to soothe him. Then, when he had done, Savonarola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
spoke. ‘You have need of three things. First, true and
lively confidence in the Divine grace.’ To this the invalid
replied, ‘I am penetrated therewith.’ ‘Secondly, you must
restore what you have wrongfully appropriated, and make
restitution a duty for your sons.’ Lorenzo reflected a moment,
then assented by a movement of the head. ‘Lastly, you
must restore to the people of Florence their freedom.’ The
invalid turned away his head without answering, and the
monk left him unabsolved.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s death&mdash;to resume Poliziano’s report&mdash;was
peaceful. It seemed that it was not he who was about to
undergo the fate of all mortals, but rather those who stood
around his bed. He did not refuse what the doctors prescribed,
though he expected no effect from it. Even his old
cheerfulness had not altogether deserted him. When after
taking some food he was asked how he relished it, he answered:
‘Like a dying man.’ He embraced his relatives
and friends and begged them to forgive him if he had offended
them or shown impatience during his long illness. When
he asked to have read to him from the Gospel the history of
the Passion and Death of our Lord, at first he repeated the
words of Scripture, then, getting weaker, only moved his lips
and at last his fingers, in token that he still followed the
sense. When death drew near, a crucifix was held out to
him; he opened his eyes, kissed it and departed. This was
on Sunday, April 8, 1492, about the fifth hour of the night.</p>

<p>What a strange abundant variety of cares and pleasures,
of labour and enjoyment, of thought and action, of poetry
and realism, of danger and success, of evil and good, had been
crowded together into that life of barely forty-three years!</p>

<p>The tidings of his death naturally put all Florence in
commotion. Almost simultaneously with it came the news
that the physician Piero Leoni had thrown himself into a well
at Francesco Martelli’s villa at San Gervasio by the Porta
Pinti, whither he had been secretly taken because his life
was threatened at Careggi, as he was suspected of an intent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
to poison. It was not known whether the unhappy man
really perished by his own resolve or by another’s hand.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> As
usual, prodigies were believed to have presaged the event with
which all minds were occupied. In Sta. Maria Novella a
woman had started up in the middle of the sermon, crying
out that she saw a raging bull, with burning horns, overthrowing
the church. Three days before Lorenzo’s death a
flash of lightning had struck the lantern of the Cathedral
and hurled down some heavy blocks of marble on the north-west,
the side towards the Medici’s dwelling; one fell in
through the roof, another crushed the house of Luca Rinieri.
On the night of the death a meteor was said to have been
seen to shine over Careggi and then vanish.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Three hours
after death the body was taken from Careggi to San Marco;
there it remained in the chapel of a lay-brotherhood till
the following evening, when the clergy of San Lorenzo came
in solemn procession to fetch it away and carry it to the
sacristy of the Basilica. The ceremony at church was simple,
as he had wished it. The mourning was general. The
upper ranks, almost entirely attached to the Medicean
interest, felt deeply the loss of the man whose firm and practised
hand had guided the helm for so long, and whose
vices had been outweighed by his brilliant qualities. Who
should tell them what might happen now? On April 10,
wrote Bartolommeo Cerretani, the whole city went to Piero.
The people lamented the loss of him who, at whatever cost,
had procured them peace and comfort.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> There were indeed
some who rejoiced at his death and expected good from it;
there is no lack of testimony to such feelings in memoirs
not intended for the eyes of strangers. ‘As I know,’ writes
Alamanno Rinuccini, when describing the merits and
demerits of the Medici, ‘that many falsehoods about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
have been spread, in eye-service and deceit, by flatterers and
perverters of the truth, mostly bought and corrupted by him
by means of honours and enrichment at the public expense.
I intend to give a brief account of his life and manners, with
both of which I was intimately acquainted: not by way of
detraction, nor from hatred towards him, from whom I have
received divers marks of distinction, to which I had no claim,
but in compliance with truth. The multitude regarded the
signs before his death as prognostics of great evils; they
would have been prognostics of great good, had the citizens
known how to use their opportunity.’<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>On April 13, three days after the funeral, the assembled
councils and the people, in conjunction with the Signoria,
issued the following decree:<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> ‘Whereas the foremost man
of all this city, the lately deceased Lorenzo de’ Medici, did
during his whole life neglect no opportunity of protecting,
increasing, adorning, and raising this city, but was always
ready with counsel, authority, and painstaking, in thought
and deed; subordinated his personal interest to the advantage
and benefit of the community; shrank from neither trouble
nor dangers for the good of the State and its freedom; and
devoted to that object all his thoughts and powers, securing
public order by excellent laws; by his presence brought a
dangerous war to a conclusion; regained the places lost in
battle and took those belonging to the enemies;&mdash;whereas he
furthermore, after the rare examples furnished by antiquity,
for the safety of his fellow-citizens and the freedom of his
country gave himself up into his enemies’ power, and, filled
with love for his house, averted the general danger by drawing
it all upon his own head; whereas, finally, he omitted
nothing which could tend to raise our reputation and enlarge
our borders; it hath seemed good to the Senate and people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
of Florence, on the motion of the chief magistrate, to establish
a public testimonial of gratitude to the memory of such
a man, in order that virtue may not be unhonoured among
the Florentines, and that in days to come other citizens may
be incited to serve the commonwealth with might and wisdom.
But whereas the memory of Lorenzo needs no outward
adornments, as it has struck deep root, and blooms fresher
every day, it hath been determined to transfer to Piero, the
eldest son of the deceased, the heir of his father’s dignity
and successor to his fame, the public honour due to his father
and his ancestors. So much the more, as Piero has already
in his youth displayed the endowments of his father and is in
some degree his image, and has already shown himself such
that we may hope he will, by God’s assistance, tread in his
father’s steps.’</p>

<p>On April 10, before break of day, a special messenger
brought to the Cardinal the fatal tidings which had been
expected for several days. Giovanni, his attendants and
servants, at once put on mourning, the house was hung
with black, and all the Cardinals, headed by Francesco
Piccolomini, paid visits of condolence to their youthful colleague.
Four days after, a Requiem was sung in Sta. Maria
sopra Minerva; Franceschetto Cybò and the Count of Pitigliano
were present in coarse black mantles reaching to the
ground, and also Onofrio Tornabuoni, the Medicean agent
at the Roman Curia, and many prelates and gentlemen.
The next day Innocent proclaimed the appointment of
Giovanni de’ Medici to be legate in Tuscany, whither the
boy wished to return in consequence of his father’s death,
that he might consult on the condition of affairs with his
brother, to whom he had already written many letters. The
young Cardinal was so much moved that he had to retire for a
while during mass.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Nothing is known of the remarks made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
by the Pope (who sent an orator to Florence) on the loss of
the man with whom he was so intimate, although throughout
his pontificate he had never personally seen him. The
case is otherwise with regard to King Ferrante. On the
morning of April 11, being then in the neighbourhood of
Palma, he learned from a letter of Marino Tomacelli that all
hope was abandoned. He thereupon wrote to Gioviano
Pontano at Rome that he should offer the Pope all the means
at his command to prevent a disturbance of the peace of
Italy, and place at his disposal the troops commanded by
Virginio Orsini. To Virginio he wrote the same evening,
after receiving news of the death (‘which has grieved us to
the depths of our soul’), charging him to act without further
orders from him according to the disposition of the Pope, in
case the latter should have need of him.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> To those around
him the King is said to have thus spoken: ‘That man’s
life has been long enough for his own deathless fame, but
too short for Italy. God grant that now he is dead, that
may not be attempted which was not ventured on during his
life.’<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>That Innocent was entirely of one mind with Ferrante
in considering the maintenance of the house of Medici in
the position it had hitherto occupied as necessary for the
preservation of the existing political system, may be judged
from the answer addressed to the Pope, from Vigevano on
April 20, by Lodovico il Moro in the name of his nephew
Gian Galeazzo.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Whatever might be the real feeling of
Sforza, who had already two months ago drawn up the instructions
for that embassy to Charles VIII. which was the
first step towards the ruin of Italy&mdash;at all events, his letter
throws a favourable light on the Pope’s views of the matter:
‘Your Holiness could have written me nothing more welcome
than what you have lately communicated to me as to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
desire to keep Italy in peace, and maintain the sons of
Lorenzo de’ Medici in their position. For I have nothing
more at heart than the preservation of the peace of Italy,
for which I have not shrunk from subjecting myself to intolerable
burdens and struggles; and between me and the
Medici family there is a bond of friendship both public and
private. My memory recalls how the illustrious prince
my grandfather (Francesco), aided by the pecuniary means
of Cosimo de’ Medici, regained the state of our forefathers,
which after his father-in-law’s death had been, so to say,
lost. I likewise remember how since then Florence and the
house of Medici have never been in a position to need our
help without our placing arms and money at their disposal.
I am therefore glad that amid the deep mourning occasioned
by the death of the illustrious Lorenzo, your Holiness’s letter
calls upon me to do that to which my own inclination
prompted me, and which is as interesting to me as if it
concerned my own personal welfare. For not only your
Holiness, to whom my attachment to the Medici family is
known, but all who know anything of Italian affairs must
be convinced that I shall continue to act towards the sons
of Lorenzo as my predecessors acted towards his father and
grandfather. No one can imagine that I shall not tread as
heretofore in the footsteps of my ancestors; for this friendship
with the Medici has always been cultivated and confirmed
by practical proofs on both sides, up to the present
hour, and has not only never experienced a disturbance, but
has been constantly strengthened, to the advantage and
pleasure of both parties. Perseverance in this mind is made
doubly my duty, by old and new relations with the Medici,
and by the circumstance that I shall thereby suit the views
of your Holiness.’</p>

<p>Lorenzo de’ Medici was buried in the sacristy of San
Lorenzo, the resting-place of his father, uncle, brother,
grandparents, and other relatives. When Giovanni, who
left Rome on May 11, 1492, to return home, stood here at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
father’s grave, he little thought that more than twenty-three
years later, on Advent Sunday, 1515, he was destined to kneel
there in tears as the spiritual head of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Amid
all the splendour and greatness to which the Medici afterwards
rose, not one of them seems to have thought of raising
a monument to the most famous man of the family, though
the greatest sculptor of the age helped to immortalise on
their monuments two of its insignificant members. In
1559 Duke Cosimo I. caused the mortal remains of Lorenzo
and his brother Giuliano to be laid in the porphyry sarcophagus
which they had erected for their father and uncle.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">At</span> the age of forty-three Lorenzo was called away. His
span of life had been but a short one for such manifold activity
and such lasting fame. A remarkable man, he was
the most brilliant representative of a remarkable time; in no
one else were its qualities and excellences united in such a
harmonious whole. Energetic in action, and earnest in his
endeavours to watch the phases of progress in the establishment
of a new order of things; endowed with the liveliest
susceptibilities and the quickest perceptions, combined with
the earnestness and thoroughness of a student; with a
strongly sympathetic feeling for art, yet capable of immediate
application to the business of life; he united imaginative power
with clear common sense, the capacity for lofty projects with
that for patient calculation; he had all the qualities of poet
and statesman, connoisseur and patron of learning, citizen
and prince. He was indefatigable and persevering in the
endless business thrown upon him by his position as the
leader of a peculiarly constituted state; with a quick and
unerring eye he was able to grasp the whole and yet observe
its smallest detail; in his riper years he was cautious and
prudent, keeping his object immovably in view without blind
self-confidence or presumption, though fully alive to his own
position and that of the state which he represented. He
passed with wonderful ease from practical to speculative politics,
from science to poetry. Few could equal him in comprehensive,
manifold, creative gifts, or in the most delicate sense
of beauty, and the most active interest, with the deepest insight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
into the character and purposes of art. In his home
and family relations he was kindly, sociable, cheerful, even
amid physical sufferings; not free from errors which even in
earlier years and afterwards far more decidedly loosened the
bond between him and his wife, yet still unaffectedly attached
to all his family; to the admirable mother, many of whose
qualities he had inherited, to the wife who was not of his own
choosing, to the children to whom he was a wise and prudent
counsellor, and a tender but not a weak father. Moreover he
was a warm, attentive, and constant friend, attracting and
attaching to himself the most different natures, ever ready
to help in counsel and action, interposing and interceding for
high and low with equal zeal amid a thousand occupations.
He was gifted with a delicate sense of propriety, though he
could not keep himself free from the Epicureanism of the
time, which exacted a sacrifice even from him; and vividly
conscious of the power of culture in the field of the Church,
though a frivolous materialism threatened to weaken that
power and lead him seriously astray in his views of life.</p>

<p>He was not without the weaknesses and vices of his time.
They cramped his policy, though it still stood far higher than
that of most princes and statesmen of the age, both Italian
and others. He was superior too in honesty and consistency,
and, at least during the last ten years of his life, in unalterable
adherence to the preservation of peace and unity, and
to a feeling of nationality such as answered to the ideas of
the time, from which it is not fair to demand conceptions
unfamiliar to it. His home policy has called forth severe
blame both on account of his progressive violations of the
constitution to increase his personal authority, and of the
corruption he employed in order to obtain undisturbed control
of the finances. With regard to the latter, it is
hard to see how, had he lived longer, he could have avoided
national bankruptcy, unless indeed he and the state had
contrived by the preservation of peace to restore an internal
equilibrium, for which in his last years he had begun to lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
some slight foundation. As to the former, many of his contemporaries
expressed the opinion that he aimed at becoming
a recognised prince, and was only waiting for a favourable
opportunity&mdash;such as his entrance on the office of Gonfalonier,
as soon as that dignity should fall to him on his reaching
the legal age. And yet he, who had everything in his power,
could not have lacked means and opportunities, if this had
been his object. But he knew the city and the people too
well to be blind to the obstacles and dangers which threatened
to impede that path.</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst evil of Lorenzo’s government lay in
the increasing incongruity between the outward form and the
real power, and in the displacement of authority from its
legal centre, whereby both law and moderation were called
in question. Personal influence decided everything in politics,
in administration, in finance, even in the dispensation of
justice. The more clear-sighted among Lorenzo’s contemporaries
did not fail to perceive this radical evil, and expressed
their opinion of it in the bitterest terms. Nevertheless not
merely did Florence escape such excesses as occurred in all
other Italian states, almost without an exception, but Lorenzo’s
government was on the whole free from the violence which
had characterised that of Cosimo. Doubtless the greater tranquillity
of the time, the more secure position of the Medici, the
fact that the people had been longer accustomed to their rule,
contributed to this result; but so also did the character of
the man himself. Lorenzo was ambitious to rule, but he was
no tyrant. On the one hand he was too keen-sighted, and
had calculated too accurately the character and traditions of
the people; on the other hand his own nature was too grand,
too open, too high-minded, too warm-hearted, and also too
fond of enjoyment; finally, he was too much of a Florentine
citizen, and that not merely in name but in his appearance,
his dress and his bearing. He would have had nothing
to distinguish him from the rest of the community, had there
not been permitted or granted to him, ever since the Pazzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
conspiracy, a suite consisting at first of four of his own confidants,
afterwards of twelve men paid by the Signoria. It
is true that this was a grave offence against civil equality.
This citizen-character was not kept up by Lorenzo’s sons&mdash;it
was said of Piero that he was not a Florentine by nature&mdash;and
its outward signs vanished altogether in some others of
the race. In his own family Lorenzo maintained simplicity;
in public affairs, however completely he held the real direction
of them, he tried to keep up fair appearances; though
indeed he could not prevent a complaint that Ser Piero da
Bibiena brought into his court of chancery matters which
rightly belonged to the police-jurisdiction of the Eight. On
important occasions he liked to consult with many persons,
but with each one separately; and then he formed his own
decision independently.</p>

<p>On his arbitrary proceedings in money matters there were
very divided opinions even in his own time. If he had not
used the money of the state he would have been ruined; and
it was said that his ruin would have entailed that of everybody
else; that all he took to save his credit and to lead a
showy life was nothing in comparison of the losses to which
a state would be exposed by incapable administration; that
one single unskilful or ill-timed measure might cost a state
dearer than Lorenzo’s whole course of government; that the
ultimate and highest object of the Medici, for which they
calculated everything they did or left undone, was indeed
their own benefit; but they were and always had been Florentine
citizens, and in most cases their interest and that of the
state was one and the same. So said the favourable party
after Lorenzo’s death and Piero’s fall. To this it was answered
that the ultimate object of the Medici was not supremacy like
that of the Albizzi in a state becoming more and more aristocratic
in form, but simply autocracy, which they had sought
to attain under the form of democracy, by removing the influence
of the noble families and favouring many members of
the lower classes. A cunning tyranny like that of Cosimo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
or one softened by affability and generosity like that of
Lorenzo, was all the worse because it spread poison among
the people, preparing the way for the endurance of something
harder. The truth of this view was proved at no very distant
time.</p>

<p>For good or for evil the Medici’s influence struck deep
root in Florence. They made the lasting existence of the
Republic impossible. ‘We are suffering’&mdash;such are the
words placed by Francesco Guicciardini in the mouth of a
man frequently named in this history&mdash;Paol’Antonio Soderini&mdash;after
their expulsion in 1494&mdash;‘from two mortal wounds:
the Pisan war, and the exile of the Medici. With their
numerous friends in the city and country, and the greatness
of their name abroad, they will give us a great deal of trouble.’
He was right. The Medicean party would have given the
death-blow to the Republic of 1495 as well as to that of
1527, even if external circumstances had not come to their
assistance. The work was made easier for them because
here, as in many other republics, the relation of the ruling
commonwealth to her subject towns and districts was an unnatural
and very oppressive one; these subjects, influenced
by the traditions of their old freedom, obeyed only on compulsion;
and endured a personal government such as was
permanently established forty years after Lorenzo’s death,
more easily than their former position&mdash;perhaps because
their old masters now had to bow their necks to the same
yoke.</p>

<p>In the ninth chapter of his Florentine history, the great
writer just mentioned sums up at the close, in a few words,
his masterly picture of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s influence on his
native city. The city, he says, was not free under him; but
it could not have found a more endurable and better master.
For while there proceeded from him much good, owing to
his natural goodness and amiable disposition, the evils, so
far as they proceeded from the nature of the tyranny itself,
were slight and limited to absolute necessity, and infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
slighter still where his own will was concerned. Therefore,
although many might rejoice at his death, yet it grieved
those who had a share in the government, and even those
who had some ground of complaint against him, for no one
knew whither the change might lead.</p>

<p>This was soon discovered. Lorenzo the Magnificent had
been scarcely two years and a half in his grave, and his sons
had not yet found time to raise a monument to his memory,
when the stately edifice of which Giovanni d’Averardo had
laid the foundation-stone, which Cosimo had built up, and
Piero and Lorenzo enlarged and adorned, crumbled to pieces.
On November 9, 1494, Luca Corsini, one of the Priori, shut
the gate of the palace of the Signoria in the face of Piero de’
Medici, on his return from the French camp at Sarzana, and
thus gave the signal for a great change in the destinies of
the commonwealth. Lorenzo’s son and successor had neither
his father’s sagacity and experience, nor his father’s authority
with the great men nor the attachment of the people, to help
him. In the long-threatened division which brought down
France to interfere in the dynastic troubles of Italy, he first
made common cause with the house of Aragon against the
Moro and the French king, and then, as soon as the latter,
having crossed the Alps without obstacle, was threatening
Florence, the young man lost his head and his courage, and
without a shadow of right delivered up the fortresses of the
state, Sarzana, Pietrasanta, Pisa, Livorno, to the foreigner.
As soon as the old cry of ‘People and liberty!’ was raised
in a burst of anger at this unheard-of proceeding, Piero
mounted his horse and was glad when he found himself safe
on the road to Bologna, whither he was followed by his
brothers and those of his adherents who were most deeply
compromised, while the mob was sacking the Medici palace
and the houses of the most detested tools of their financial
administration. Thus in a moment a revolution was accomplished
which created a new popular state, under the
eyes of a foreign sovereign. That same November 9 Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
VIII. entered Pisa, where the rising against Florence began,
and a week later he was in the palace in the Via Larga.
This state lasted, amid the greatest internal and external
difficulties, for nearly eighteen years, and then gave way to
a new Medicean supremacy, which after another three years’
interruption, brought about by similar extraneous circumstances,
formed itself into an hereditary autocracy, lasting
till, after the lapse of two full centuries, the altered family
died out in the altered country, and was mourned even then,
when but little was left of the qualities which had lent it so
much splendour.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s friends and adherents met with various fates.
Of the heads of the party, now left to their own resources,
some attained influence and power in the new commonwealth;
others came to a bloody end. Of the friends who stood round
his death-bed, one, Angelo Poliziano, did not live to see the
catastrophe that befell the once splendid house. He was
taken away on September 24, 1494; and the evil reports
which his life, notwithstanding all his high intellectual gifts,
had in some measure called forth, did not spare him even in
death. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola died on the day of
the French king’s entry, and the comforter of his last
moments was the man whom Lorenzo, too, had summoned
in the hour of death&mdash;the Predicant monk of Ferrara who
was destined to stir Florence to her deepest depths, and to
die amid the flames lighted by his own hand. Marsilio
Ficino and Cristoforo Landino were doomed to witness the
misfortunes of the family to whom they owed everything and
were attached by hereditary affection, and to survive the
execution of many friends, and the dispersion of the rich
treasures of art and learning which adorned the house in
which they had been born and grown up. Of the younger
members of the circle, some spent eighteen years in exile
and vicissitude, to come back at last and sun themselves in
the splendour, brilliant indeed but fleeting, of the pontificate
of Leo X. Then the seeds of literature and art sown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
days of Lorenzo, sprang up in the works of Ariosto and
Machiavelli, of Raphael and Michelangelo; but the political
edifice, whose chief pillar he had been, and the national
polity were irrecoverably destroyed; Italy had become the
whole world’s battle-field; Lombardy was subject to the
French, Naples to the Spaniards; the crowd of dynasties in
Romagna had been swept away by the flood; while of those
who had once held in their control the weal and woe of the
peninsula, Ferrante and Alfonso of Aragon had died in distress
and remorse, and Lodovico il Moro had ended his days
in a French prison.</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Book VI. Chapter VIII.</i></p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">The</span> interview of Savonarola and Lorenzo de’ Medici has given rise
to a controversy which has never been definitively settled. The account
of the monk’s biographers, Giovan Francesco Pico and Pacifico
Burlamachi, cannot be reconciled with that given in Politian’s letter
above referred to. This last has the air of containing a mitigated
version of the facts, intended to efface the bad impression made by
current reports of the matter; and the third exhortation put into
the monk’s mouth by Politian&mdash;‘that he should endure death with
patience’&mdash;sounds almost like a commonplace, considering the
gravity of the moment and the characters of the interlocutors. C.
F. Meier, in his History of Savonarola (p. 52, &amp;c.), and Villari, in
‘La Storia di Girolamo Savonarola’ (i. 136), accept the version
given by the Ferrarese monk’s earliest biographers, and Villari
tries to establish it by a long note (p. 155-158). But this version
contains great improbabilities. How should the dying man, who
had just received the viaticum, make another confession? And
what could Savonarola have meant by his famous third demand&mdash;what
practical use or effect could he expect from it, or from the
possible assent of the dying man? The story looks like an invention
of the after-days of excitement. The doubts as to the authenticity
of the books of Burlamachi and Pico, which, it is suspected,
were fabricated in the convent of San Marco and adorned with these
authors’ names, are of little consequence in this connection, as in
any case the tradition was doubtless current among Savonarola’s
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Bartolommeo Cerretani gives, in the third book of his MS.
chronicle, the following account of Lorenzo’s last hours:&mdash;‘April 7,
about the fifth hour, Lorenzo received the Lord’s Supper. As his
illness was making such rapid progress, Messer Pier Leoni, otherwise
an excellent physician, lost heart; other doctors were at once
sent for, but it was too late. Feeling his end approaching, the sick
man sent for his eldest son Piero, gave him divers exhortations,
and then sent him away. About the twentieth hour he began to
cry out: “I am dying and there is none to help me!” All hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
to him. He said he wanted to get up a little, and had himself lifted
out of bed, but only to be laid down immediately. The pains were
so violent that he lost consciousness. Those standing round him
began to weep, for they thought he was dead. A Camaldulensian
who was present took off his spectacles, and holding them to his
mouth perceived that he still breathed. A restorative was given
him and he came to himself. Then he called for his son again and
spoke to him softly, so that none of the others heard. After that
his condition rapidly grew worse, so that he gave up the ghost on
the 8th, about the fourth hour of the evening, in the arms of a valet.’</p>

<p>The doctor who, though a learned man, certainly seems to have
blundered in his judgment as to Lorenzo’s illness, put an end to his
life next morning as has been related above (p. 461), by jumping
into the well at the Martelli villa at San Gervasio before Porta
Pinti.</p>

<p>Sannazzaro’s poem in terza rima (in Roscoe, Ap. lxxviii.) on
the death of Piero Leoni attributes it to the instigation of Piero
de’ Medici. The fragment beginning: ‘Fu trovato essere stato
gettato in un pozzo’ &amp;c., published in Fabroni (l. c. ii. 397) as being
from some anonymous author in the Magliabecchiana, is borrowed
from the Ricordi of Alamanno Rinuccini (p. cxlvi). Petrus Crinitus
and Valerianus (De literatorum infelicitate) take it for granted that
the doctor in his agitation took his own life; and Cerretani certainly
indicates that Leoni, who a short time before had been in good hopes,
lost his head. He states, moreover, that the Medici’s grooms threatened
the life of the physician, who was, therefore, taken to San
Gervasio, and that the report of his death by the violence of others
was immediately spread, but was unfounded. Burcard in his defective
report (p. 175) alludes to Piero de’ Medici’s complaint by
saying that the fatal termination of the illness was to be attributed
to wrong medical treatment, and raises a supposition that at Rome
there was believed to have been a murder.</p>

<p>In May, Demetrius Chalcondylas wrote from Milan to Marcello
Virgilio Adriani: ‘Thou hast announced to me two sad events; the
flash of lightning which has struck the principal church of the city,
occasioned so much ruin, and presaged so great evils; and the death
of Lorenzo, the most famous man of our time, who was distinguished
in so many ways. His decease causes me deep sorrow, not merely
on account of the loss, which touches us all in no slight degree, but
also on account of what I personally lose, who have always found
him a kind patron. And to all this is added the sad and fearful
death of Piero Leoni, which has shocked me more than anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
for a long time past. Believe me, Marcello, this end casts a shadow
over Lorenzo’s death, and is a dishonour to the family and to the
whole city. For although thou, like others, writest that he threw
himself into the well, yet it is difficult to convince thoughtful people
that such a wise and learned man, who, as thou thyself also tellest
me, treated Lorenzo in his illness with so much care, could have
been seized with such madness as to choose so shameful a death.’
(Bandini, Collectio, &amp;c., p. 22).</p>

<p>In Fabroni, l. c., and Roscoe, ‘Life of Leo X.’ (Ap. No. xxii.)
will be found the letters written by Cardinal Giovanni to his brother
after their father’s death. The first may be given here. The
original is in the curious mixture of Latin and Italian sentences
which was then still in vogue.</p>

<p>‘My beloved brother, now the only support of our house. What
shall I write to thee, when only tears are left me? For when
I consider that our father of blessed memory is taken from us, I am
nearer weeping than speaking. What a father! None was kinder
than he to his children; of this facts are witness. Therefore it is
no wonder that I lament and can find no rest; and my only consolation
is that I have thee, my brother, in our father’s place. It is
for thee to command, for me to obey, and thy commands will always
give me the greatest pleasure. Try me; nothing shall find me
backward. But I beg thee, my Piero, be towards all, especially
towards thine own people, as I wish thee, beneficent, kind, courteous,
gracious; thereby all is obtained, all is preserved. Not because I
mistrust thee do I remind thee of this, but because it is my duty.
I am consoled and sustained by the concourse of mourners to our
house, the universal sympathy, the mourning of the whole city, and
other things which help to alleviate sorrow. But what consoles me
above all is that I have thee, whom I trust more than my words
are able to express. As to what thou wishest arranged with his
Holiness, nothing has been done, as it seemed better to take another
way, on which the ambassador will report to thee, and which seems
as if it must lead more easily to the object. Rome, April 12, 1492.’</p>

The collection of Italian poetry made by Lorenzo de’ Medici for Don Federigo
is to be found&mdash;not, indeed, in the original, which was lost probably during the
French invasion of Naples in 1495&mdash;but in a copy made either at the end of the
fifteenth or in the sixteenth century, and now in the Florentine National Library
(Magliabecchi), to which it passed with the Palatine MSS. (Fr. Palermo, <i>I manoscritti
Palatini di Firenze</i>, Flor. 1853 <i>seq.</i>; i. 353 <i>seq.</i>). This MS. belonged to
Marco Foscarini, with whose library it went in 1800 to Vienna, and later to the
Archduke, afterwards Grand Duke, Leopold, when he collected and published the
poems of Lorenzo (<i>Opere di Lorenzo de’ Medici</i>, Florence, 1825, 4 vols. i. p. xxvi.,
where occur also Apostolo Zeno’s remarks on the MS. in question). On the MSS.
and printed copies of Lorenzo’s poems, compare the same edition, i. p. xiii.-xlv.,
and Gamba, <i>Testi di Lingua</i>, pp. 648-660. For a complete critically revised text
much is still wanting, even after the splendid edition of 1825, which came out
under the auspices of the della Crusca Academy. A large and well-arranged
selection, <i>Poesie di Lorenzo de’ Medici</i>, Flor. 1859, has an introduction by Giosuè
Carducci, which has been a guide to much of what is said here of Lorenzo as a poet.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The letter of Lorenzo to Don Federigo, from which extracts are given above,
is among the Riccardi MSS., No. 2723, under the name of Poliziano, and was published
under that name in the edition of the <i>Rime</i> by V. Manucci and L. Ciampolini,
Flor. 1814. The mistake is palpable; Poliziano’s age and the agreement
with Lorenzo’s views in the commentary on his poems, show it as clearly as do
the historical allusions.</p>

The copy of <i>Christophori Landini Florentini ad illustrem Fridericim principem
Urbinatem Disputationum Camaldulensiam libri IV.</i>, now in the Laurentian
library, was written by Pietro Cennini, son of Bernardo, the first Florentine
printer, finished at the end of spring, and collated with the original. Cf. Bandini,
l. c. ii. 188 <i>seq.</i> (see also p. 3 <i>seq.</i> as to the meeting and the persons present). The
first edition is said (<i>ibid.</i> p. 192) to have been printed in 1475(?) and a second at
Strasburg in 1508. It was translated into Italian by Antonio Cambini, a literary
man much employed by Lorenzo and also in the service of his son the Cardinal.
He was also in communication with the Este family, and afterwards attached
himself to Savonarola, at whose fall his house was burnt down. (Cf. Cappelli, l. c.
p. 309; Villari, <i>Storia di G. Savonarola</i>, ii. 388.)</p>

There has been much question as to the relation between the original ‘Orfeo,’
which the author wanted to destroy, and the later one, which was turned into a
tragedy in several acts. The latter was published in 1776 by Ireneo Affò, with a
detailed introduction and <i>excursus</i>; and in 1812 Vincenzo Ranucci wrote some
extensive philological observations upon it which were reprinted in the Carducci
edition, pp. 113-188. The question which has lately been raised as to Poliziano’s
authorship of this second version must be left for decision to the poet’s biographers.
There is a prospect of a detailed account of his life by I. del Lungo.</p>

It has been shown in vol. i. p. 299, that Poliziano did not begin this poem so
early as has been imagined, from an idea that Giuliano’s tournament was held at
the same time as that of his brother. That he was at work upon it in 1476 is
proved by the allusion to the death of Simonetta, the young beauty to whom
Giuliano’s heart was given, an event which Poliziano sang also in Latin, <i>Prose
volgare</i>, p. 149. [In Simonettam, ‘Dum pulchra effertur nigro Simonetta
pheretro.’]</p>

<i>Prælectio in Priora Aristotelis analytica cui titulus Lamia. La Strega, prelezione
alle Priora d’Aristotile nello studio Fiorentino l’anno 1483 per Ang. Ambr.
Poliziano volgar. da Isidori del Lungo</i>, Flor. 1864. The immediate neighbourhood
of Fiesole, where Poliziano was so thoroughly at home, still recalls the witch-traditions
of the middle ages. The subterranean chambers of the Roman theatre
(unhappily in great part destroyed) on the northern slope of the hill are called by
the people the Witches’ grottos&mdash;(Buche delle Fate); they are not far from the
stone grotto on the eastern slope, the Fonte Soterra, which is always full of cool
water, and the Latomie, which Brunelleschi opened for the purposes of his wonderful
buildings (Fr. Inghirami, <i>Memorie storiche per servire di guida all’Osservatore
in Fiesole</i>, Fiesole 1839), p. 60 <i>seq.</i></p>

Accolti (on whom cf. Vespasiano da Bisticci, l. c. p. 442 <i>seq.</i>) died in 1466,
aged 51; the seals were not delivered to Scala till March 1473, so they must
have been put into commission (Manni, l. c. 15). Accolti’s dialogue, <i>De præstantia
virorum sui ævi</i>, which, in spite of the many reservations made by the author from
personal motives, will deserve regard as the work of a man in high position, was
first printed by Ben. Bacchini, Parma, 1689, and later by Galletti in <i>Philippi

1477, but could not assume the office owing to the death of his father. That he
was in Florence in 1488-89, engaged in affairs of state, is shown by the following
letter from Lorenzo to Giovanni Lanfredini at Rome: ‘Messer Francesco Massimi
is going back, having gained the approval of the whole city as well as my own.
He has in truth conducted himself so well that I have thought good to recommend
him to his Holiness and to the Cardinal Giovanni Colonna. I do the same to you,
and beg you to bear witness that his conduct could not have been more praiseworthy.
In consideration of his good offices I shall be glad if you will introduce
him wherever it may be agreeable to him.’ Florence, March 13, 1489 (<i>Med. Arch.</i>

Vasari’s <i>Life of Fra Giocondo</i> (ix. 155 <i>seq.</i>) is very imperfect and leaves room
for further study. On Giocondo’s works in his own city see G. Orti Manara, <i>Dei
lavori architettonici di Fra Giocondo in Verona</i>, Ver., 1853. On his collection of
inscriptions see G. B. de Rossi, <i>I Fasti municipali di Venosa restituite alla sincera
lezione</i>, Rome 1853. (From vol. cxxxiii. of the <i>Giornale Arcadico</i>.) According to
the <i>Novelle letterarie di Firenze</i> for the year 1771, p. 725, the Medicean copy was
sent to Pope Clement XIV., but has never been seen either in the Vatican archives
or the library. On the other copies, and the second collection, differing from the
first in some respects, less numerous, and dedicated to Ludovico de Agnellis,
Archbishop of Cosenza, cf. De Rossi, p. 7 <i>seq.</i> The dedication&mdash;‘Laurentio Medici
Fr. Io. Jucundus S. P. D.’&mdash;is in Fabroni, ii. 279 <i>seq.</i> It ends: ‘Vale feliciter

This controversy has never rested from the time of Angelo Maria Bandini,
who published in 1755 the <i>Vita e Lettere di Amerigo Vespucci gentiluomo fiorentino</i>,
down to our own days, which have witnessed a new defence of the Florentine’s
claims by the Brazilian, F. A. de Varnhagen. It will be sufficient here to refer
the reader to the facts published by Oscar Peschel in the <i>Zeitalter der Entdeckungen</i>,
p. 305 <i>seq.</i>, and in an essay on Amerigo in the periodical <i>Das Ausland</i> (No. 32,
1858). Vespucci’s well-known work on his second journey (Bandini, p. 64) is
addressed to Lorenzo de’ Medici, the son of Pier Francesco.</p>

The dedication (to Piero de’ Medici) of a treatise on Architecture by Antonio
Averlino, called Filarete (see below, p. 135), shows that the Church had not been
rebuilt in 1460: ‘Resta ancora la chiesa a rinovare.’ The resemblance of its
architecture to that of the chapel of the Madonna de’ Voti, afterwards dell’Incoronata,
in the cathedral of Mantua, always regarded as a work of Leon Bat.
Alberti, awakens a suspicion that he may have been concerned in the building
at Fiesole. Cf. Gaye, l. c. i. 200 <i>seq.</i>; 263. Vasari, <i>Life of Filarete</i>, iii. 290.</p>

Round the altar is the following inscription: ‘Ædem hanc sanctissime

Franciscus is doubtless meant the saint to whose order the convent belonged, and
not, as Richa and Moisè suppose, Francesco de’ Pazzi, Andrea’s grandson. A
letter of indulgence from Card. Pietro Riario, October 8, 1473, speaks of Jacopo
de’ Pazzi as the founder.</p>

nothing to do with the driving out of the Duke of Athens, as Moisè (<i>Palazzo de’

1504 to Michel Angelo’s ‘David,’ and has stood since then on the side of the Loggia
de’ Lanzi towards the Uffizi. Vasari (l. c. p. 251) wrongly thinks it was executed
for the Signoria.</p>

Executed in 1436; a pendant to the equestrian figure of Niccolò Maruzzi of
Tolentino (d. 1434) by Andrea dal Castagno. The improper introduction of these
equestrian figures into churches paved the way for similar monuments in marble,
such as may be seen especially in Venice. In the cathedral of Florence was a
complete figure of Piero Farnese on a mule, as he rode to a fight with the Pisans
in 1363.</p>

Complete edition by Gaetano and Carlo Milanese, <i>Il Libro dell’arte o Trattato
della Pittura</i> (Flor. 1859). There is a German translation, <i>Das Buch von der Kunst</i>,
&amp;c., by Albert Ilg (Vienna, 1871). The general supposition, from Baldinucci down
to Tambroni, the first editor of the treatise (Rome, 1821), viz., that Cennini wrote
it in 1437 in the Stinche prison, is derived from a gloss to the Laurentian MS.
which proceeds from the copyist instead of referring to the author. The same
postil gave rise to the statement that a fresco in Giotto’s style, representing the
driving out of the Duke of Athens, and brought to light at the demolition of the
prison, was painted by Cennini. (Fr. Bacchi, <i>Illustratore Fiorentino</i>, pt. v., Flor.
1839).</p>

On Filarete’s treatise and the two dedications, cf. Vasari, iii. 290, 291, and
Gaye, i. 200-206, where will be found the dedication to Fr. Sforza. (Cf. <i>supra</i>,
p. 122.) Filarete gives us a foretaste of the art-phraseology of Federigo Zuccaro.
For the rest, he says to Sforza: ‘If my book is not elegant, take it as the work,
not of an orator nor of a Vitruvius, but of thy master-builder who cast the doors
of St. Peter’s.’</p>

The circumstance that the name Sangallo is to be found as early as 1485
(notes to Vasari, l. c. p. 214) hardly tells against the truth of this story, as the
building was probably begun long before. The appearance of the name in the
collection of the Barberini drawings, begun in 1465, dates from a later time.</p>

Vasari, <i>Life of Valerio Vicentino</i>, ix. 236, <i>et seq.</i> G. Pelli, in his <i>Saggio
istorico della R. Galeria di Firenze</i> (Flor. 1779), i. 8, <i>et seq.</i>, ii. 9, <i>et seq.</i>, gives
some account of the Medici collections. In the Museum of Naples alone (formerly
in the palace of Capodimonte) are preserved more than twenty cameos with Lorenzo’s
name, and a great number of gems set as rings. They came from a Bourbon-Parma
inheritance, many of the family treasures having passed, through Margaret
of Austria, wife of Duke Alessandro de’ Medici, to her son by her second marriage,
Alessandro Farnese, and, at the extinction of the Farnese family, to the Spanish
Bourbons. The question whether all the stones marked with Lorenzo’s name or
with the initials L. M. are modern, or whether the name or initials were also engraved
on antique gems to indicate the owner, cannot be discussed here. The
epigram:</p>

Cf. i. 405. G. Milanesi, <i>Sulla Storia dell’Arte Toscana</i>, p. 292. Crowe and
Cavalcaselle (iii. 159) strangely see in this commission a proof of the estimation
in which Botticelli was held as an artist. These pictures of shame, with which
tardy debtors were also punished, <i>e.g.</i> Ranuccio Farnese in 1425 (Gaye, l. c., i.
550) were not much relished by artists, and seem to have been only executed at a
high price; in this case it was forty florins. Andrea del Castagno, to whom
Vasari erroneously attributed these paintings, which were executed more than
forty years after his death, received from a similar commission in 1445 the surname
‘degli Impiccati,’ which poor Andrea del Sarto seems to have likewise
dreaded during the siege in 1530.</p>

(<i>Ital. Forsch.</i>, ii. 262), on the picture, which is much blackened and varnished, but

Miniature painting can only be treated of very briefly here. The editors of
Lemonnier’s <i>Vasari</i> have added much information to the biographies of Fra
Angelico (iv. 25, <i>et seq.</i>), Don Bartolommeo (v. 44, <i>et seq.</i> [on Attavante, <i>see</i>
p. 55]), Gherardo (<i>ibid.</i> p. 60, <i>et seq.</i>), &amp;c., and furnished materials valuable for a
history of Florentine and Sienese art, in a detailed commentary (vi. 159-351).
On the Dominicans, cf. V. Marchese, <i>Memorie</i>, i. 171-210. In the same author’s
work on San Marco are drawings of two miniatures by Fra Benedetto. The passages
referring to the treasures of Urbino, Upper Italy, &amp;c., may be passed over

The old tradition which has come down to our own days, which derives the
Buonarotti Simoni from the Counts of Canossa (and which was believed in the
family itself in Michelangelo’s days, as must be concluded from Ascanio Condivi’s
words in his biography, published during the artist’s lifetime), rests on no historical
foundation. Cf. G. Campori, <i>Catalogo degli artisti sc. negli Stati Estensi</i> (Modena
1855), p. 100 <i>et seq.</i> The noble family of Buonarotti has of late years become extinct
in Florence. Lodovico, Michelangelo’s father, was already connected with
the Medici when holding an official post in the Casentino, where his son was born
within view of the great mountain of Alvernia&mdash;the <i>crudo sasso</i> of the <i>Divine
Comedy</i>.</p>

Napoli contra il Re Ferdinando I.</i> (first printed at Rome in 1565) contains many
illustrations and corrections from the <i>Regis Ferdinandi Instructionum Liber</i> (unfortunately

secretaries and barons, which were printed in 1487 and 1488 by Ferrante’s command
and sent to the foreign courts, and reprinted with notes by Stanislao d’Aloe
as an appendix to his edition of Porgio (Naples, 1859).</p>

Guidoni’s reports (in Cappelli) contain a number of notices and hints from
which Lorenzo’s state of mind at the time of the treaty of 1486 and his relations
with the allies may be clearly made out. On Sarzanello, see Carlo Promis, <i>Storia
del forte di Sarzanello</i> (Turin, 1888). From one of Guidoni’s reports it appears
that the Florentines also used mines: ‘sperasi <i>per certe cave fatte</i> ... che S. Francesco
si acquisterà fra due dì.’</p>

Spedaletto, which passed after Lorenzo’s death to Maddalena Cybò and later
to the Corsini family, to whom it still belongs, was visited in November 1654 by
Cardinal de Retz, coming from Spain by sea, before he proceeded to the Grandduke
Ferdinand II. at the Ambrogiana near Empoli, and thence to Rome. He
knew that the villa, which he calls L’Hospitalità, had belonged to Lorenzo de’
Medici, but he wrongly places here the scene of the battle in which Catiline fell.

Jacopo Gherardi had been formerly in the service of Cardinal Ammanati. His
writings passed into the Venetian archives after the sack of Rome in 1527. The
Medicean archives contain a series of despatches relating to this mission. Lorenzo
writes from Spedaletto on September 11-19; on the 21st he was in Florence; on
October 2-10, at Spedaletto again. He says once: ‘I am here according to my
custom, for the care of my health.’</p>

The palace (afterwards called Quaratesi) and the villa (for a time Catalani-Valabrègue,

to the latter’s natural son, Ottavio, with a reservation of the usufruct to Lorenzo’s
sister Caterina, the widowed Duchess of Camerino. The villa belonged for a time
to Eleonora Cybò, daughter of Lorenzo, and wife of Gian Luigi Fiesco, Count of

Palagi</i> (Flor. 1872). [Cf. I. del Lungo in the <i>Arch. stor. Ital.</i>, s. iii. vol. xvii.
p. 147 <i>et seq.</i>] Lorenzo the younger was the head of the Compagnia del Broncone,
and Giuliano that of the Compagnia del Diamante. There are still to be seen in
Florence, in the Church of St. Ambrogio, in the Canto alia Mela, and the Canto
di Monteloro, some inscribed tablets recalling the Potenze; but they are of rather

On the Piovano Arlotto, who died in 1483, see D. M. Manni, <i>Veglie Piacevoli</i>
(3rd ed., Flor. 1816), where are many details of the jests and buffooneries. The
<i>Novella del Grasso Legnaiuolo</i> has been often printed and imitated; there is an
edition with introduction by D. Moreni (Flor. 1820). Gaye (l. c. i. 169) has
produced some original documents which cast some doubt on the accounts of the
‘fat cabinet-maker’ collected by Manni; the claims of Antonio Manetti, known
from his connection with the Dante-literature (cf. <i>ante</i>, p. 51), to the authorship
of the story have been lately vindicated. Cf. Papanti, <i>Catalogo dei Novellieri</i>
(Livorno, 1871), vol. ii. 11. The story of Bianco Alfani is in Manni’s edition of
the <i>Cento novelle anticke</i> (Flor. 1782), i. 211 <i>et seq.</i></p>

Repetti, l. c. i. 380. Palla Strozzi paid 7,390 gold florins for Poggio a
Cajano; and his beautiful villa of Petraja, which he had bought of the Brunelleschi,
served as security for the purchase. In the next century, after the attempt of the
Strozzi and their friends against Duke Cosimo had failed, Petraja was confiscated
and became state property. Angiullesi’s <i>Notizie storiche dei palazzi e ville
appartenenti alla R. Corona di Toscana</i> (Pisa, 1815) contain no notice of the
earlier history of Poggio a Cajano.</p>

The story of Lorenzo’s last days may be read in the long letter written by
Poliziano from the villa at Fiesole on May 18, 1492, to Jacopo Antiquario of
Perugia, <i>Pol. Epist.</i> 1. iv. ep. 2, in Fabroni, l. c. i. 199-212, and in Roscoe, Ap.
No. LXXVII. Cf. G. B. Vermiglioli, <i>Memoire di Jacopo Antiquario</i> (Perugia, 1813).
Politian’s letter is a rhetorical composition full of unctuous phrases, but highly
valuable as containing the testimony of an eye-witness.</p>

Moreni, <i>Descrizione istorico-critica delle tre Cappelle Medicee in S. Lorenzo</i>
(Flor. 1813), p. 103. At the revolution of 1494 the party hostile to the Medici
did not entirely spare even the monuments, for the inscription on the tomb of
Cosimo the elder was removed on account of the ‘<i>Pater patriæ</i>’; in 1497,
during the Savonarola excitement, all the Medici coats of arms were taken away
or covered, and replaced by the red cross of the people. The reappearance of the
ball-escutcheon after the revolution of 1512 was referred to in an epigram by the
father of Benvenuto Cellini, wherein he prophesies the attainment of the Papal
dignity by one of the family:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfn8">‘Quest’arme, che sepolta è stata tanta,<br />
Sotta la croce mansueta,<br />
Mostra hor la faccia gloriosa e lieta,<br />
Aspettando di Pietro il sacro ammanto.’</p>

This curious monody, so unlike Politian’s other Latin compositions, stands at
the end of his works in the edition of 1498. [In <i>Del Lungo</i>, p. 274.] The poem
in terza rima, on Lorenzo’s death, printed in the edition of his Italian poems
published at Florence in 1814, from a Riccardi MS. (in Carducci’s ed. p. 382 <i>et seq.</i>)
is unquestionably not Politian’s.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
